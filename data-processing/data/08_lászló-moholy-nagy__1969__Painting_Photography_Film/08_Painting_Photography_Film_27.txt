PRODUCTION 
REPRODUCTION 
Without wishing to solve in a sentence all the imponderables of human 
life, we may say that the composition of a man is the synthesis of all his 
functional mechanism; i.e., that the man of a given period is most perfect 
when the functional mechanism of which he is composed - the cells as 
much as the complex organs- is being used to the limits of its biological 
capacity. Art brings this about - and this is one .of its most important 
missions, for the whole complex of effects depends upon the perfection of 
the functioning. Art attempts to establish far-reaching new relationships 
between the known and the as yet unknown optical, acoustical, and other 
functional phenomena so that these are absorbed in increasing abundance 
by the functional apparatus. · 
It is a basic fact of the human condition that the functional apparatus 
craves for further new impressions every time a new exposure has taken 
place. This is one of the reasons why new creative experiments are an 
enduring necessity. From this point of view the creations are valuable only 
when they produce new, previously unknown relationships. This is yet 
another way of saying that reproduction (repetition of existing re­
lationships) without enriching points of view must from the special point 
of view of creative art be considered at best only a matter of virtuosity. 
Since production (productive creativity) is primarily of service to human 
development, we must endeavour to expand the apparatus (means) which 
has so far been used solely for purposes of reproduction for productive 
purposes•). 
•) I h~ve investigated this in two spheres: with the gramophone and photography. We can, 
of course, devise similar programmes for other means of reproduction: for the talking film 
(by Engel, Massole, and Vogt), for the television (Telehor), etc. In thecaseofthe gramo­
phone the situation is as follows: the business of the gramophone to date has been to repro-
