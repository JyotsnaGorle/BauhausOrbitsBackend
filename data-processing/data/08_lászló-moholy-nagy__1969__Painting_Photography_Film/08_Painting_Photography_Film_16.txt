This means- since the ideal plane can never be realised- a practical appli­
cation drawn from the complexities of colour composition, while colour 
composition itself as the sovereign expression of a man in his spiritual 
and physical essence must develop further along its biological path, be­
yond the transient truth of form-determining events .

Against the idea that the easel painting denotes a decline in comparison 
with the painting of the great frescos, we may argue that, on the con­
trary, manuscript and bible illustrations, easel paintings, landscapes, 
portraits, etc., were revolutionary achievements viewed from the angle of 
representation. Since the discovery of the laws of perspective, the easel 
painting has neglected colour as such and has addressed itself almost whol­
ly to representation. This has reached the zenith of its representational 
intentions in photography, but at the same time, of course, the nadir of 
colour composition. 
The Impressionists were the first to give colour back to civilised man. 
This development of the easel painting has led to a clear division between 
colour and representational composition. 
colours it is only the relationships of the colours which operate. A resonance arises which 
displaces colour as a self-accentuated material and creates instead an effect in which colour 
relationships alone play a part. This gives the whole room a sublimated, atmospheric 
quality: comfortable, festive, diverting, concentrating, etc. Some system in the choice and 
distribution of colour is determined by the room and its function (hygiene, lighting tech­
nique, communication, etc.). It follows that the habit of painting walls in different colours 
cannot be indulged everywhere indiscriminately.
