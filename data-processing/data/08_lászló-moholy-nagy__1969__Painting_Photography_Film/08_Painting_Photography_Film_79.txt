EXPLANATION OF THE SCORE: COLOUR SONATINA (3 BARS) 
1. LINE : Arrangement of bars for the colour-display. Several bars can from time to time be run together 
to form a larger movement. 
2. LINE : Colours. The sonatina begins with white light. 
3.LINE : Music. 
4. Ll N E: Position of the movable lamps. During the first part of the sonatina in bar 8-I2 the position of the 
lamps changes into a horizontal position arranged in 2 rows one above the other. The lamps, so 
adjusted that they can be opened and closed quickly or slowly, are worked by 2 people. They are 
opened in the order I, 2, 3, 4, etc. By overlapping the light-beams the fields of light appear in order 
from the top downwards (see line 9 and compare the sound-movement in line 3). 
5. LINE: The templets (plates) are opened in the order I, 2, 3, 4Â· 
6. and 7. Ll N E: Main switch and lamp switch. 
8. LINE: Resistances. In the 8th vertical column the power gradually cuts out - compare the fading out in 
the sound line - until the sources of light are completely darkened. The light from lamp 2 only 
lasts longer - 'd' in the sound line is held longer - and forms a transition to the new combination 
in bar 2. 
Bar 2, column . I . It is impossible to see the resistances being switched on for at the moment of 
darkness all the lamps are closed and only lamp I is emitting light. 
9. Ll N E: The over-all picture in lines. The inter-penetrating light-planes are schematically represented by 
lines.
