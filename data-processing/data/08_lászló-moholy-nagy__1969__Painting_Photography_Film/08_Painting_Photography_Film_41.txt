ON TECHNICAL 
POSSIBILITIES AND 
DEMANDS 
The practical prerequisites of an absolute filmic art are excellence of 
materials and highly developed apparatus. 
A prime obstacle to realisation has hitherto lain in the fact that absolute 
films have been made either by laboriously drawn cartoons or by light­
shado·w plays which are difficult to shoot. What seems to be needed is a 
camera which will shoot automatically or otherwise work continuously. 
The number of light-phenomena can also be increased by using mechani­
cally movable sources of light. 
The analogy of light composition in the still picture with m:: without cam­
era is bound to suggest a variety of devices in the making of a film or­
ganised in that way. Thus little movable plates with slits (patterns, etc.) 
can be slipped between the source of light and the light-sensitive film so 
that there are continual variations in the exposure of the film. This 
principle is very flexible and can be used equally in representational 
(object-) photographs and in absolute light composition .

By studying existing work and asking the right questions one could 
discover innumerable technical innovations and potentialities. Analysis 
of optophonetic relationships alone must lead to radically altered new 
forms. But no amount of study, experimentation, speculation, means 
anything if it does not spring from inclination and concentration, which 
are the bases of all creative activity, including photography and the film. 
We have left behind all that unavoidable fumbling with traditional op­
tical forms; it need no longer impede the new work. We know today that 
work with controlled light is a different matter from work with pigment.
