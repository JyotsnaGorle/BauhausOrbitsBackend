PROBLEMS 
OF TERMINOLOGY 
IN 
OPTICAL 
COMPOSITION

whole contemporary problem of optical creation: with 
objective and 
non-objective painting, 
easel painting and 
colour composition in an architectonic context, 
which is linked with the problem of the 
'Gesamtkunstwerk'; with 
static and Â· 
kinetic optical composition, with the material 
pigment and the material 
light.
