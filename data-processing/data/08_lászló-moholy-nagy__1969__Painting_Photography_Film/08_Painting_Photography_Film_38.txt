SIMULTANEOUS 
OR POLY-CINEMA 
A cinema should be built equipped for different experimental purposes in 
regard to apparatus and projection screen. One can, for example, vis­
ualise the normal projection plane being divided by a simple adapter into 
different obliquely positioned planes and cambers, like a landscape of 
mountains and valleys; it would be based upon the simplest possible 
principle of division so that the distorted effect of the projection could be 
controlled. 
Another suggestion for changing the projection screens might be: one in 
the shape of a segment of a sphere instead of the present rectangular one. 
This projection screen should have a very large radius and therefore very 
little depth and should be placed at an angle of sight of about 45° for the 
viewer. More than one film (perhaps two in the first trials) would be played 
on this projection screen; and they would not, indeed, be projected on to 
a fixed spot but would range continually from left to right or from right 
to left, up and down, down and up, etc. This process will enable us to pre­
sent two or more events which start independently of one another but 
will later by calculation combine and present parallel and coinciding epi­
sodes. 
The large projection screen has the further advantage of representing a 
process of movement -let us say that of a motor-car- from beginning to 
end with greater illusion (movement in the second dimension) than the 
present projection screen on which one image must always be fixed.
