PHOTOGRAPHY 
WITHOUT CAMERA

THE PHOTOGRAM' 
This potentiality can be practically utilised in the following manner: the 
light is allowed to fall on to a screen (photographic plate, light-sensitive 
paper) through objects with different coefficients of refraction or to be 
deflected from its original path by various contrivances; certain parts of 
the screen are shaded, etc. This process can occur with or without camera. 
(In the second case the technique of the process consists in fixing a differÂ­
entiated play of light and shadow). 
This course leads to possibilities of light-composition, in which light must be 
sovereignly handled as a new creative means, like colour in painting and 
sound in music. I call this mode of light-composition the photog ram. (See 
p. 71 to 78.) It offers scope for composing in a newly mastered material. 
Another way of moving towards productivity might be to investigate and 
utilise various chemical compositions which can fix light phenomena 
(electro-magnetic vibrations) invisible to the eye (like, for example, X-ray 
photography). 
Yet another way is to construct new cameras, first of all using the camera 
obscura, secondly eliminating perspectival representation. Cameras with 
systems of lenses and mirrors which can encompass the object from all 
sides at once and cameras which are constructed on optical laws different 
from those of our eyes.
