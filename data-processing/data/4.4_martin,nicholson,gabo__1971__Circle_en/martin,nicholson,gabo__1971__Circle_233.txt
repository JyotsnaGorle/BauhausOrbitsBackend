common with either ; since the peculiarity of the 'iy"itcm resides neither in tiH·

As floors of this type provide a uniform bearing surface tin oughouL thei r 
length and breadth, their ends can be cantilevered out to carr) supplementary 
loads. They are therefore ideal in combination \\'ith non-supporting \\ alls, sue h 
as continuous expanses of horizontal fenestration. 1 t is hard to realize this in 
the obscurity of a warehouse, for the latent possibil·ities of mushroom-~lab con­
struction can only find architectural vindication in buildings which arc flooded 
with the light of day on all sides.* 
The American engineer C. A. P. Turnert had been experimenting with 
the mushroom-slab system at the same time as l\faillart, but he did not venture 
to carry the slab to its logical development and use it as a self-sufficient struc­
tural entity. American designers have not been able to rid themselves of the 
idea that a slab is subject to stress in separate directions, and embed their rods 
diagonally across the floor like intersecting beams. American practice has not 
fully grasped the structural role of the slab, and consequently the forms of its

*The first specifically architectural endorsements of this principle did not occur until 
twenty years after Maillart's initial experiments. Brinkmann and Van der Vlugt's splendid 
Van Nelle Factory in Rotterdam (1927-28) is the outstanding example, although it embodies 
the ponderous American type of mushroom-headed columns.
