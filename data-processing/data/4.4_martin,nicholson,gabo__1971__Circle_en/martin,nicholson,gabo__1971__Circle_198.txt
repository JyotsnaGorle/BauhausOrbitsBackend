THE PRINCIPLE OF ANONYMITY 
offers us, at least would help to establish some degree of a modern equivalent 
of the standardized design vocabulary of the eighteenth century, in the spirit of 
which, the perfecting of the type form could be pursued-and in the spirit of 
which the re-establishment of a stable cultural purpose could also be pursued-if necessary 
we must wait till later to enlarge the technical sphere to include the sociolo­
gical.* 
One of the things that the potential new tradition of natural anonymity 
that we see again on the horizon can do, is to release us at least from the irre­
levances of architectural 'self-expression' and the confusion of idea that accom­
panies it. Whether we can expand this potential tradition into a new folk archi­
tecture, owing as little as the work of the Georgian architect-builder or of the 
Victorian architect-engineer to the exploitation of personality or to connois­
seurship, one of recognizable standards-a true vernacular-depends on the 
growth of what Lethaby called 'a movement in the common mind'. We can 
start by giving the common mind its opportunity. 
*That, even if the sociological side is tackled first, the cultural cannot be relied upon to 
readjust itself immediately is shown by the case of Russia. There, the social unity of purpose 
which has successfully been re-established has not yet crystallized itself into a ne·w cultural 
one; art of a bourgeois nature still flourishes, partly in reaction against the extremist, revolu­
tionary movement that tried to set up an abstract ideology with inadequate technical equip­
ment; but largely because, owing to psychological instability, the superficial advertisement of 
progress becomes more important than the fact of progress-sociological development has 
much faster than educational.
