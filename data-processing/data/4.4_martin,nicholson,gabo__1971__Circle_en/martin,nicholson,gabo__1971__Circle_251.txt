The most essential factor in artistic education is the unit] of its entire struc­
ture in all stages of development. It can only grow concentrically, like the annular 
rings of a tree, embracing the whole from the beginning, and at the same time 
gradually deepening and extending it. The dividing up of the training into in­
dividual sections, carried out separately as regards time and place instead of 
simultaneously, must destroy its unity. It is the sense of coherence in what he 
learns, and not the accumulation of organically unconnected scraps of knm'­
ledge, which makes the adolescent harmonious, far-sighted and producti\'e. A 
creative art training such as we have here attempted to outline as an ideal aim 
would fuse art with technique, and reintegrate the artists into the daily \\·ork 
of the nation.
