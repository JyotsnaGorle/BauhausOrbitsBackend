VIEW FROM THE NORTH 
The project illustrates a health city planned on 72 acres of land and 
situated ten minutes journey from the centre of Lille. In this city 
the patient will find all the elements necessary for his cure and will be 
taught to preserve his health. The architect has attempted to concen足
trate within a single group the hospital service of the city and to re足
construct out-of-date buildings in this single centre. The centraliza足
economy of administration and closer general co-opera足
tion involves 
tion. Within the various buildings in this group the interior planning 
allows complete flexibility and ease of adaptation for all new needs 
and scientific developments. By rationalizing movements and needs 
economy and ease of working are assured: in this respect great 
attention has been paid to height, express lifts connect the most 
distant services in go seconds.
