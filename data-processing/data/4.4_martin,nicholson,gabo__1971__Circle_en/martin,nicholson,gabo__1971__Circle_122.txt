SCULPTURE 
By Barbara Hepworth

FuLL sculptural expression is spatial- it is the three-dimensional realization of 
an idea, either by mass or by space construction. The materials for sculpture 
are unlimited in their variety of quality, tenseness a nd a liveness. But for the 
imaginative idea to be fully and freely projected into stone, wood or any 
plastic substance, a complete sensibili.ty to material an understanding of its 
inherent quality and character-is required. There must be a perfect unity 
between the idea, the substance and the dimension : this unity gives scale. 
The idea the imaginative concept-actually is the giving of life and vitality

three-dimensional mass-it is the chosen perfected form, of perfect size and 
shape, for the sculptural embodiment of the idea. Vision is not sight- it is the 
perception of the mind. I t is the discernment of the reality of life, a piercing of 
the superficial surfaces of material existence, that gives a work of art its own 
life and purpose and significant power.

perceived intuitively because it is entirely a quality of thought and vision. 
Sculpture does not gain or lose spiritual significance by having more or less of 
physical attributes. A vital work has perfect co-ordination between conception 
and realization; but actual physical contours do not limit a perfected idea . 
I t does not matter whether a sculpture is asymmetrical or symmetrical- it
