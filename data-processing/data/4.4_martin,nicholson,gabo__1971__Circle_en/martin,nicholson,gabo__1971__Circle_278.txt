THE DEATH OF THE MONUMENT 
where people continued to cycle to work, instead of using street cars, were 
better prepared to take advantage of motor transportation than large cities 
that had invested heavily in trolley systems, elevateds and subways. 
The deflation of our mechanical monuments is no less imperative than the 
deflation of symbolic monuments: the biotechnic age, surely, will be marked by 
a simplification of mechanical utilities: a simplification which is made possible 
by the limitation of city growth and by the orderly relation of the functions of 
a city so as to permit a minimum expenditure upon the mechanical means of 
living. So a well-planned city will be oriented as a whole for sunlight and pre­
vailing winds: the architecture, in turn, will be adapted to the special climatic 
conditions, even to such an extent that special sun-reflectors may be used as 
auxiliary heaters in the cold months. This will do away with the need for over­
coming the effects of bad planning and orientation by means of expensive air­
conditioning apparatus- just as the development of better insulating materials 
than the plaster wall and the brick or stone exterior and the single glass window 
will permit the use once more of simple forms of radiant heating. 
Our present overload of mechanical utilities in the dwelling-house and the 
city, particularly conspicuous in American metropolises, is a symptom of our 
inability to think in terms of the total reality: when we utilize our available 
knowledge of geography and climatology, of the strength of materials and the 
properties of insulation, a good part of our mechanical substitutes are super­
fluous. But the fact is that the so-called Machine Age has treated machinery as 
ornaments: it has retained the vacuum cleaner, when it should have done away 
with the rug; it has retained the steam-heater to produce sub-tropical heat in 
the dwelling-house, when it should have invented a permanent form of insula­
tion which would have done away with the extravagant heating of cold walls; 
it has retained the private garage as an ornament to the private free-standing 
dwelling-house- effectively spoiling its immediate open space- \·\'hen it should 
have used the art of community planning to group both houses and garages in 
such a way as to create a livable environment. 
If the machine were not an ornament, if it did not symbolically express a 
quality of futile contemporary desire, almost our contemporary religion, such 
perversions of energy could not be explained. It only remains to note that this 
is a bastard religion: half its achievements mock the very mechanical and 
scientific principles it seeks to enthrone. As a monument, the machine is sub­
ject to the same ironic deflation that applies to all other attempts to wall out 
life: indeed, the first condition of our sun·ival in cities is that we shall be free to
