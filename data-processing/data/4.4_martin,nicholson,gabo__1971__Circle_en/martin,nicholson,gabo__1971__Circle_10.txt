TH E CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA IN ART 
By N. Gabo 
OuR century appears in history under the sign of revolutions and disintegra­
tion. The revolutions have spared nothing in the edifice of culture which had 
been built up by the past ages. They had already begun at the end of the last 
century and proceeded in ours with unusual speed until there was no stable 
point left in either the material or the ideal structure of our life. The war was 
only a natural consequence of a disintegration which started long ago in the 
depths of the previous civilization. It is innocent to hope that this process 
of disintegration will stop at the time and in the place where we want it to. 
Historical processes of this kind generally go their own way. They are more like 
floods, which do not depend on the strokes of the oarsmen floating on the waters. 
But, however long and however deep this process may go in its material de­
struction, it cannot deprive us any more of our optimism about the final out­
come, since we see that in the realm of ideas we are now entering on the period 
of reconstruction. 
We can find efficient support for our optimism in those two domains of our 
culture where the revolution has been the most thorough, namely, in Science 
and in Art. The critical analysis in natural science with which the last century 
ended had gone so far that at times the scientists felt themselves to be in a state 
of suspension, having lost most of the fundamental bases on which they had de­
pended for so many centuries. Scientific thought suddenly found itself confronted 
with conclusions which had before seemed impossible, in fact the word 'im­
possibility' disappeared from the lexicon of scientific language. This brought 
the scientists of our century to the urgent task of filling up this emptiness. This 
task now occupies the main place in all contemporary scientific works. It con­
sists in the construction of a new stable model for our apprehension of the
