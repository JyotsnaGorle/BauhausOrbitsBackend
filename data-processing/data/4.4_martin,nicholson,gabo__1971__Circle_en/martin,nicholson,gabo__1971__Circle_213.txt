primary initiative is within the ranks of the producing forces, matcJ ial m.mu­
f'arturing companies, and the consumers' interest must be campai~ncd for. 
The first form of rehousing, as we sec, calls but for a minimum of conscious 
consumer's acceptance of what can be considered the type of habitational com­
modity and it concerns only in exceptional cases directly the lo\\'cr-rental 
classes. U ncler this form of building activity types of habitation change rather 
too gently and often imperceptibly outside ofinconscquential no,·clties in orna­
mental embellishment and certain technical improvements \\'ithout true inte­
gration. The more depreciated units automatically slide dO\\·n to lo\,·er rental 
levels, thus providing dwelling facilities for the financially weak. The lower 
rental brackets of the population remain second-hand and third-hand con­
sumers, find the typical difficulties in repair, upkeep and operation of second­
hand and third-hand commodities and therefore more or less fail in the proper 
maintenance of these properties. This is equally true for v;orking people 0\\ n­
ing and operating a ten-year-old originally costly 'motor car, which except for 
its deeply reduced purchase price does not fit their requirements'-and for a 
lO\\'-wage-class family inhabiting and sub-letting a spacious apartment or ob­
solete mansion. Amassed neglected structures are and have been the result in 
nearly all American cities far beyond the areas commonly designated as slums. 
:\ premeditated functional differentiation of the sections comprised in a city or 
regional plan is thus frustrated and the true meaning of site values becomes in 
many instances more than cloudy. 
Possibly one of the most detrimental features of such a development is the 
lack of rational relations between proportioned dwelling areas and well-con­
nected employment markets within reasonable commuting distance. Unable 
to pay even the low rental of the second-hand dwelling commodity, or unable 
to find any employment in its neighbourhood, consumers in an increasing num­
ber of cases have attempted 'self-help' action, and like the Co-operatives ofUn-
