QUOTATIONS 
Henry Moore 
I. I DISLIKE the idea that contemporary art is an escape from life. Because 
a work does not aim at reproducing the natural appearance it is not therefore 
an escape from life- it may be a penetrating into reality; not a sedative or drug, 
not just the exercise of good taste, the provision of pleasant shapes and colours in 
a pleasing combination, not a decoration to life- but an expression of the signi­
ficance oflife, a stimulation to greater effort in living. 
2. Architecture and sculpture are both dealing with the relationship of 
masses. In practice architecture is not pure expression but has a functional or 
utilitarian purpose, which limits it as an art of pure expression. And sculpture, 
more naturally than architecture, can use organic rhythms. Aesthetically 
architecture is the abstract relationship of masses. If sculpture is limited to this, 
then in the field of scale and size architecture has the advantage; but sculpture, 
not being tied to a functional and utilitarian purpose, can attempt much more 
freely the exploration of the world of pure form.
