QUOTATIONS 
Ben Nicholson 
I. It must be understood that a good idea is exactly as good as it can 
be universally applied, that no idea can ha\·e a universal application which is 
not solved in its own terms and if any extraneous elements are introduced the 
application ceases to be universal. 'Realism' has been abandoned in the search 
for reality: the 'principal objective' of abstract art is precisely this reality. 
2. A different painting, a different sculpture are different experiences just 
as walking in a field or over a mountain are different experiences and it is only 
at the point at which a painting becomes an actual experience in the artist's 
life, more or less profound and more or less capable of universal application 
according to the artists' capacity to live, that it is capable of becoming a part, 
also, of the lives of other people and that it can take its place in the structure of 
the world, in everyday life. 
3· 'Painting' and 'religious experience' are the same thing. It is a question 
I, 
of the perpetual motion of a right idea. 
4· You cannot ask an explorer to explain what a country is like which he 
is about to explore for the first time: it is more interesting to investigate the 
• 
vitality of the present movement than to predict its precise future development; 
a living present necessarily contains its m"'·n future and tvvo things are indis­
putable- that the present constructive movement is a living force and that 
life gives birth to life.
