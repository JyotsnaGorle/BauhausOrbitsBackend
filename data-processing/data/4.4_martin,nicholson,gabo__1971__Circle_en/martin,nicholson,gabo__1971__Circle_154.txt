AGRARIAN REORGANIZATION, 1934 
T he scheme is a practical attempt to make a systematic study of agrarian reform without 
which town reorganization cannot be complete. Town inhabitants cannot be attracted to 
country life if this remains in its present condition. The co-operative village with its repair 
shops, stores, housing, educational and cultural centres, is as necessary as the new type of 
farm. T he farm illustrated is therefore part of a large scheme of reorganization and is in itself 
not an isolated example, but a type form. l ts units are standardized but will allow a variety of 
arrangements according to situation, aspect, etc.
