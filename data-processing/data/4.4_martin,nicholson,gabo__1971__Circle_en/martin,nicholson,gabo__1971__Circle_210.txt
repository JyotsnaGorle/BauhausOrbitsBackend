Glass and steel, together with the modern sound and heat insulating mater­
ials (cork, glass-\\ ool, etc. ) lead to a new type of hospital: buildings are from six 
to twelve storeys built in recessed stages so that wide terraces for the patients are 
formed immediately in front of the sick-rooms. The system prevents the shading 
oflower storeys by the usual balconies and provides a maximum amount of sun­
light and view and a minimum of built-up area and passageway, thus saving un­
necessary walking and transport. (Elberfeld Hospital, I, roo beds, south aspect. )
