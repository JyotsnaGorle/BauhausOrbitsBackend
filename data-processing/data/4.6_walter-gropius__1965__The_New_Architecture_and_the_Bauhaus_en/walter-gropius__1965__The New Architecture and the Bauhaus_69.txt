side by side so as to develop the pupil's creative 
powers and enable him to grasp the physical 
nature of materials and the basic laws of design. 
Instruction was confined to observation and re­
presentation (with the object of inculcating the 
ideal identity of form and content); associations

with any kind of ' style' were studiously avoided.
The first task was to liberate the pupil's indi­

only means of realizing the natural limitations 
of our creative povvers. That is why collective 
work was not considered important at this stage. 
Subjective and objective observation, and the 
laws of representational and abstract design, 
were taught turn and turn about. Even ordi­

a powerful stimulus in these respects. 
The Preparatory Instruction was intended to

developed by him in the Bauhaus itself. Our Preparatory Instruc­

Professor Josef Albers (vide ProfessorMoholy-Nagy's Von Mat­
