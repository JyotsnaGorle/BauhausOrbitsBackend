In 1925 the Bauhaus migrated to Dessau: a 
move -vvhich coincided with an important change 
in its organization. The dual control of each 
workshop by a teacher of design and a practical 
instructor was no'v superseded by that of a 
single master. In point of fact the fusion of 
their separate spheres had (as -vvas hoped) been 
automatically effected in the course of train­
ing the first generation. Five old Bauhaus 
students were now chosen as heads of the new 
1 
workshops.

Even after the Bauhaus had moved to Dessau it could only 
rely on a relatively very small income, which was defrayed by an 
annual vote from the municipality. Including the salaries of 
teachers, etc.-of whom there were about 24 to 180-200 pupils 
-the total grant amounted to some 100,000 R eichsmarks (then 
slightly under £5000). In addition to this, however, the town had 
to meet the interest and annual reduction charges on the capital 
outlay represented by the new buildings and their equipment, 
which had cost somewhere about 850,000 Reichsmarks (at that 
time roughly equivalent to £42,450). The royalties from the 
licences we granted to various firms for the mass-production of 
Bauhaus models (Furniture, Carpets, Textiles, China, Electric­
Light Fittings, etc) contributed a subsidiary source of revenue 
which steadily increased as time went on. 
My desire to keep fees very low, and to provide as many free 
places as possible for talented but impecunious pupils, had the 
official support of the municipal authorities. I was able also to 
pay pupils for any of their Bauhaus work that proved saleable: an 
arrangement which assured many of them a (necessarily very 
straitened) means of subsistence during their three-years' 
course of training.
