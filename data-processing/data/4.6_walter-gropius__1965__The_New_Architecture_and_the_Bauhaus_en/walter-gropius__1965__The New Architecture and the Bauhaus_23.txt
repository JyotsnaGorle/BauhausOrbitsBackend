nical resources we can novv command as a direct 
result of them, are embodied in the very differ­
ent appearance of the already numerous ex­
amples of the Ne.w Architecture. 
Just think of all that modern technique has 
contributed to this decisive phase in the rena­
scence of architecture, and the rapidity of its 
development! 
Our fresh technical resources have furthered 
the disintegration of solid masses of masonry in­
to slender piers, with consequent far-reaching 
economies in bulk, space, weight, and haulage. 
New synthetic substances steel, concrete, glass 
- are actively superseding the traditional raw 
materials of construction. Their rigidity and 
molecular density have made it possible to erect 
wide-spanned and all but transparent structures 
for which the skill of previous ages was mani­
festly inadequate. This enormous saving in 
structural volume was an architectural revolu­
tion in itself. 
One of the outstanding achievements of the 
new constructional technique has been the abo­
lition of the separating function of the wall. In­
stead of making the walls the element of sup-
