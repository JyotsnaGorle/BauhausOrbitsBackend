from 30 degrees in the case of the two-storied 
to 17 ·50 degrees in the case of the ten-storied 
blocks. In other words we gain the immense 
advantage of a much more generous amount of 
light, sun and air through having an almost ten 
times wider interval between the blocks than in 
the case of two-storied buildings again with­
out any corresponding practical drawbacks. 
Valuable space is made available for car-parking 
between the blocks, and shops can be built along 
their rear as well as their front elevations. 
It is evident, therefore, that the height-limit 
imposed by regulations is an irrational restric­
tion which has hampered evolution in design. 
Restriction of the number of dwellings per acre 
is, of course, a very necessary safeguard, but 
one that has nothing to do with the height of 
the buildings concerned. Overcrowding can be 
far more effectively combated by reducing their 
maximum floor area or total cubic volume. 
That is what we ought to press for in the first 
place! If the data just cited -vvere systematic­
ally applied it would be possible to improve the 
lighting and ventilation of the business q uar­
ters, vviden their streets wholesale (with a con­
sequent abatement in noise); and yet substan-
