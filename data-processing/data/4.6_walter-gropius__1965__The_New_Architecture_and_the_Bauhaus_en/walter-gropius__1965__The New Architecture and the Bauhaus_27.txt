ing wall should be giving place more and more 
to the continuous horizontal casement, sub­
divided by thin steel mullions, characteristic of 
the New Architecture. And as a direct result of 
the growing preponderance of voids over solids, 
glass is assuming an ever greater structural im­
portance. Its sparkling insubstantiality, and the 
way it seems to float between wall and wall im­
ponderably as the air, adds a note of gaiety to 
our modern homes. 
In the same way the flat roof is superseding 
the old penthouse roof with its tiled or slated 
gables. For its advantages are obvious: (1) light 
normally shaped top-floor rooms instead of poky 
attics, darkened by dormers and sloping ceil­
ings, with their almost unutilizable corners; (2) 
the avoidance of timber rafters, so often the 
cause of fires; (3) the possibility of turning the. 
top of the house to practical account as a sun 
loggia, open-air gymnasium, or children's play­
ground; ( 4) simpler structural provision for sub­
sequent additions, whether as extra stories or 
new wings; ( 5) elimination of unnecessary sur­
faces presented to the actionofwind and weather, 
and therefore less need for repairs; ( 6) suppres­
sion of hanging gutters, external rain-pipes,
