ornan1ent seem ed to be di carded as examples of 
an i1naginary 'Bauhaus Style'; and imitators 
who prostituted our fundamental precepts into 
modish trivialities. The object of the Bauhaus 
'va not to propagate any 'style', system, dogma, 
formula or vogue, but simply to exert a re足
vitalizing influence on design . We did not base 
our teaching on any preconceived ideas of form, 
but sought the vital spark of life behind life's 
ever-changing forn1s. The Bauhaus was the first 
institution in the world to dare to embody this 
principle in a definite curriculum. To further 
the cause of its ideals, and maintain the vigour 
and alertness of that community spirit in which 
imagination and reality can alone be fused, it 
had to assume the responsibilities of leadership. 
A 'Bauhaus Style' would have been a confes足
sion of failure and a return to that very stagna足
tion and devitalizing inertia which I had called 
it into being to combat.
