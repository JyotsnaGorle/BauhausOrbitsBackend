ingit to incidental account by actually producing 
handicrafts, but as providing a good all-round 
training for hand and eye, and being a practical 
first step in mastering industrial processes. 
The Bauhaus workshops were really labora­
tories for working out practical new designs 
for present-day articles and improving models 
for mass-production. To create type-forms 
that would meet all technical, aesthetic and 
commercial demands required a picked staff. 
It needed a body of men of wide general cul­
ture as thoroughly versed in the practical and 
mechanical sides of design as in its theoreti­
cal and formal laws. Although most parts of 
these prototype models had naturally to be made 
by hand, their constructors were bound to be 
intimately acquainted with factory methods of 
production and assembly, which differ radically 
from the practices of handicraft. It is to its in­
trinsic particularity that each different type of 
machine owes the 'genuine stamp' and 'indivi­
dual beauty' of its products. Senseless imitation 
of hand-made goods by machinery infallibly 
bears the mark of a makeshift substitute. The 
Bauhaus represented a school of thought which
