Result: In proportion as the number of floors increases the 
angle of light between the blocks decreases. Thus the higher 
blocks enjoy better isolation, and insure a more rational utiliza­
tion of the size by providing a greater ratio of green open space 
per inhabitant. For instance, while the interval between the 
three-storied blocks is about double their height, it becomes al­
triple in the case of the ten-storied ones; the corresponding 
most 
ratio of planted grounds per inhabitant rising from approxim­
ately 135 square feet in the former to some 250 square feet in the 
latter. 
Moral: Existing legislation Hmiting density of population is 
superannuated in so far as it restricts the maximum height of 
buildings. We need new laws restricting density of population 
in terms of the maximum amount of floor-space per acre of 
building land, but abolishing existing Hmitations on the height 
of buildings. 
en to twelve storied tenement-blocks make the ideal of 'the 
T
City Verdant' a practical possibility.
