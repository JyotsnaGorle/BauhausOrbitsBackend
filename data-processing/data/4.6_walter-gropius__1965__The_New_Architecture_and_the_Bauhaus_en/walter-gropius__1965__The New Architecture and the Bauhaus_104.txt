1nately 300 x 7 50 feet. o'v if -vve compare the 
possibilities in regard to pace utilization and 
• 
light in the case of 2-3-5 storied buildings on 
the one hand, and 1 0-storied buildin o-s on the 
other, the follo-vving surprisino- results are ob­
tained: 
1. Given an equal angle of light between the 
blocks (say 50 degrees) the amount of utilizable 
area increases vYith the number of stories. In 
comparison with two-storied, ten-storied blocks 
have over 60 per cent. more utilizable superficial 
area; and this in spite of the fact that they enjoy 
the same amount of light and air. 
2. If we convert utilization into term s of 
economy in building land; that is to say if, as­
uming an equal angle of light for each of the 
s
blocks, we divide an identical extent of floor­
betvveen them -vve find there is a saving 
space 
of about 4i0 per cent. 'vith the ten-storied as 
the tvvo-storied ones again in spite of 
against 
each enjoying the same amount of light and air. 
5. If, however, vve estin1at e utilization purely 
in terms of light and air that is to say if we 
neither reduce the amount of building land nor 
increase the utilizable superficial area we find 
that the angle of light between the blocks falls
