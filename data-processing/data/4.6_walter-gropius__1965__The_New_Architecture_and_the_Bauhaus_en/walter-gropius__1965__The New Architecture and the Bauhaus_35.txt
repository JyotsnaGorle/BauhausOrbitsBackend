is the sort of myth which cannot sustain the 
briefest examination. In all great epochs of his­
tory the existence of standards that is the con­
scious adoption of type-forms has been the cri-

terion of a polite and well-ordered society; for 
it is a commonplace that repetition of the same 
things for the same purposes exercises a settling 
and civilizing influence on men's minds. 
As the basic cellular unit of that larger unit 
the street, the dwelling-house represents a typi­
cal group-organism. The uniforn1ity of the cells 
whose multiplication by streets forms the still 
larger unit of the city therefore calls for formal 
expression. Diversity in their sizes provides the 
necessary modicum of variation, which in turn 
promotes natural competition between dissimi­
lar types developing side by side. The most ad­
mired cities of the past are conclusive proof that 
the reiteration of 'typical' (i.e. typified) build­

any of the individual prototypes merged in it, 
an accepted standard is always a formal com­
