three basic weave\. A rib weave is a derivntive of the plain weave and is 
based on the same principle of opposites: the threads that were on top in one 
shed < •re down in the next- the essential feature of the plain weave. The rib 
weave is develo ped by a shift :~way from the plain wenve's balanced propor­
tion of wnrp and wdt. By spacing the warp clmely and usi ng, for instance, a 
heavy weft thread, horizontal ribs will be formed, the warp covering the weft.

AnOlhcr derivative of the plain weave is the basket weave. I t, too, works 
of course on the pri nciple of opposites. Its characteristic is the use of floatin~ 
W<lrp ;mel weft thre<1ds to form block pauerm which, however, lack the !Inn­
ness of the plain weave. 13y various comhin:uions of these hlock patterns, nr­

To give greater firmness to the basket-we;~vc pbin we<lYe, thin weft thrc<1ds 
can be introduced that will be <.:overed by the heavier p<1ttern wefts of the bas­
ket weave. The Colonial Americ<1n weaves with their innumerable, rich vari:t­
tions, as well as many Swedish and Finni~h weaves, are developmen ts of the 
baskct-wca w pri nci pie. 
There are a great many ~;:laborations of the twill weave, with a variety of 
eli ffcren t names, a II sharing the origi na I twi II f orn1;1 t ion of neighboring warp 
thrc<tds tying with successive wefts to the right or lcCt. There are Interlock ing 
Twi lls, Steep T w ills, Reversed Twills, Off~et Twills, H erringbone Twills, 
Undulating Twills, Pointed Twills, Shadow Twills, and a long list of othen. 
The di.1gvnal twill lines are ·srill evident, as is the pliability that is grea ter 
here than in plain weave or plain-weave derivations. Also, twills yield to 
diagona I \ll"ett:hing- and therefore an: well sui ted to O ccidema I ways of til i lor­
ing. Notice also that tweeds arc twills. Twills can be easily developed once 
the ba~i<.: principle is understood, and various m ethods fo r such developmen ts 
have been devised. Though hooks with hundreds of recipes for them have 
been published, :1 twil l suited to a ~pcc iflc o<.:casion can be constructed just 
by the usc of some sense. 
Satin weaves too, of course, have their modifications and elaborations as 
well a~ combinations. Again, the original character of the satin construction
