TuoucH elaborations are usually thought LO be an advanced stage of work, 
are often easy ex pansions from basic concepts. Intricacy and complexity 
they

arc not, to my mind, high developmenrs. Silllplicity, rather, which is con· 
dcnsation, is the aim and the goal for which we should be heading. Simplicity 
is not sirnph:ness but tlarificd vision - the reverse of the popular estimate. If

you try to speak or write clearly, you are thought to lack pro[undity: while

foJ· the very reason, I suspect, that it is beyond understanding and therefore

thi~ is to say that wha t was said about the basic weaves holds in genera l for the 
derivative~ and the c01upound weaves, except that the original characteristics 
may be diluted by some additional ones that might counteract them. 
Of course, th ere.: are abo gains somewhat outside of the srope of the basic, 
origina l \veave, for instance, in double wea\'es· based on either the plain 
weave, the twill, or the satin. Here we have, instead for instance of one plain 
weave, two, the layers lying one on top o( the other. T he same holds for twill 
or satin double weaves, of COln-se. The added feature here, besides doubled 
strength and warmth, is that a doubled usc of color is possible, an interchange 
from layer to layer, an interpenetration of color areas, which will be discussed 
later in more detail. 
It is interesting to note that where the functional aspect oE the basic 
strucun·e is moderated. aesthetic qualities frequently move to the (oreg·round: 
in fact, they often arc 1 he very reason for the structuml change.
