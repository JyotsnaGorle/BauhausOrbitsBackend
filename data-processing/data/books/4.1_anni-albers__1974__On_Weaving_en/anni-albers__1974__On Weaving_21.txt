Among high achievements in hand weaving, Coptic as well as early Peru­
vian weav ing must be recognized, the latter surpassing perhaps in inventive­
ness of weave structure. forma l treatment, and use of color, other great 
textile periods. In fact practically all known methods of 'veaving had been 
employed in ancient Peru, and also some types now discontinued. 
Today, hand weaving is practiced mainly on the medieva l shaft loom 
with few harnesses. No longer of consequence as a manufacturing method in 
an industrial age, it concerns itself chiefly with fabr ics for decorative me. In­
creasingly, though, industry is turning to hand weavers for new design ideas, 
worked out on hand looms, to be taken over for machine production. Hand 
weaving is included in the curriculum of many art schools and art depart­
mentS of colleges and universities, as an art discipline able to convey under· 
standing of the interaction between medium and process that results in form. 
It has survived through the ages as an art fonn in tapestry.

It should be real ized that the development of weaving is dependent also 
upon the development o£ textile fibers, spinning and dyeing, each a part of 
the interplay resulti ng in a fabric. Recent advances in the production of syn­
thetic fibers and new textile finishes are having profound effect upon the 
weaving of cloth.
