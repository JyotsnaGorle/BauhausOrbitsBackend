Early Techniques of Thread Interlacing 
BEGINNINGS are usually more interesting than elaborntions and endings. Be­
ginning means exploration , selection, development, a pOLcnt vita lity no t yet 
limited, not circu mscribed by the tried and traditional. For those of us con­
cerned in our work with the ad ventme of search, going hack to beginnings 
i~ seeing our~elves m irrored in othcn ' work, not in the result but in the 
process. 
There[o re, I fin d it intriguing to look at early attempts in history, n ot 
for the sake of histor ical inten .:st, that is, of looking bac k, but for the sake of

more than on e theory; and, since we do not rea lly know, we may as well spec­
ulate. Hide\ of anintab are probably the close~t prototype to fabrics. They 
are nat and plia ble and thererore useful in quite specific ways. We can cover 
ourselves with them, and this second layer of skin gives us protection from 
cold, sun, and wind. They < :an shelte• m as roors and walls. They a re useful 
implements for canying th ings. When not in use they can be folded, tha t is, 
reduced in size, and are mintculou~ iu that respect when contrasted with 
stone or wood. 
Perhaps the idea of fa bricating a stu[ of such extraordinary nature 
started the work in that direction ; perhaps. on the other hand, it all began 
not imitativel y but by someone adding one bit o f a soft strip of bark, sinew, 
vim·, or whatever, to another, filstcning them together iu various ways, ex-
