Tactile Sensibility 65 
for the work, can bring about an interesting surface. There is an intricate inter­
play between the two. A knowledge of textile construction is thus essential for 
matiere effect~. as it is for the organization of a weaving as a whole. Our experi­
ments in surfa.ce effe<:ts are therefore to be understood only as exercises to in­
crease our awareness of surface activities, since the actual work of weaving is 
only in part concemcd with the epidermis of the cloth. The inner structure 
together with it~ effects on the outside are the main considerations. Em­
broidery, on the other hand, is a working of just the surface, si nce it docs 
not demand that we give thought to the engineering ta~k of bui lding up a 
fabric. For this very reason, however, it is in dan~er of losing itself in decon•­
tiveness; for the discipline of constructing i~ a helpful corrective for the 
temptation to mere decoration. 
Our experience of gaining a representational means through the use of 
different surface qualities leads us to the use of illusions of such qualities 
graphically produced, tho ugh not by the means of representational graphic 
- that is, the modulated line. Drnwing or print that shows hatching or stip­
pling, rippled or wried lines, etc., and thus has a structural <~ppearance, 
ca n be used to produce, if not actual tactile surfaces, the illusion o£ them. The

tactil e-textile illusions produced on the typewriter may illustrate this point.

These varied experiments in articul<~tion arc to be understood not as an end 
themselves Lut merely as a help w us in gaining new terms in the vocabu­
in 
lary of tactile lang uage.
