The Loom 
A NY weaving, even the most elaborate, can be done, given time, with a mini­
mum of equipment. The main incentive, therefore, for perfecting the wcav­

submissive material. But since it is building a whole out o( srnn ll parts- a 
process that i~ time c:onsumin~ hy its very nature - the inven lion of time·

Durin~ the 4,500 years or, in .some estimates, even 8,ooo years that we be·

in weaving, as at the time of its beginning, with a rigid set of parallel threads 
in tcmion and a mobile one that uamverses it at right angl es. The main de· 
vires, in turn , have not bewme obso lt•te, but still form the nucleus of today's 
weaving imtruments. If we follow the variom inventions through the ages, 
we will not be led on historical detours, interesting per se. but will arrive at
