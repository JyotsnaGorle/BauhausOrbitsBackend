Draft Notation 
IF the construnion of a weave consisted of nothing more than the hasir 
weaves, it would be a simple umtter 10 draw the dircuiom for the intersen­
ing of warp ami fillin g- in a repre5cntationa l manner, showing the actual in­
tcrlacin~ of the threads. lt would be possible, also, to indica te by numbers 
th e warp thread~ altcmately raised or lowered. as is frequen t ly clone in the 
case of simple twills. But with the modifiration :mel elaboratio n of weaves, 
uwtters get complicated, and a ~imp l ilied manner o f no tation is needed.

A standard system for draftin~ weaves has. with s light vari;nions, been 
general ly accepted by indu~try- in power loom a~ wel l as in foot-power loom 
production. This shorthand of draft not;~ tion mes graph paper as n frmne· 
work. The space between ib evenl y ~paced verticab is underst<X>d tO indicate 
the warp threads; that between the horizontal~. spaced similarly and inter­
secting at right angles, the fil ling threacb. The little squares thus formed de­
note the imerscction of warp and weft. A raised warp thread is marked by 
filli ng out a square. Thus an empty square means that here the filling is show­
ing. T his is all that is needed to give nn accurate account of the construction 
of a weave, although, of course, it does not give a naturalistic representation 
of it. 
When the order of the interlacing threads in a weave is made out and 
recorded, it will be evident of what elements a weave is composed and how 
many warp and filling threads go into the basic unit of construction. T his 
unit contains all the structural components and is all that is actually required 
as information about a weave. H owever, a number of repeats o( this unit are 
usually needed to recognize the scheme of a design. In order to separate the
