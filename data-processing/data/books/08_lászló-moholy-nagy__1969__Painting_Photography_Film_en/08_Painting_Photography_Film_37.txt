Instead of using typography- as hitherto -merely as an objective means, 
the attempt is now being made to incorporate it and the potential effects 
of its subjective existence creatively into the contents. 
The typographical materials themselves contain strongly optical tangibili­
ties by means of which they can render the content of the communication 
in a directly visible - not only in an indirectly intellectual - fashion. 
Photography is highly effective when used as typographical material. 
It may appear as illustration beside the words, or in the form of 
lphototext' in place of words, as a precise form of representation so objec­
tive as to permit of no individual interpretation. The form, the rendering 
is constructed out of the optical and associative relationships: into 
a visual, associative, conceptual, synthetic continuity: into the typo­
photo as an unambiguous rendering in an optically valid form. (An experi­
ment, p. 124) . 
The typophoto governs the new tempo of the new visual literature .

In the future every printing press will possess its own block-making plant 
and it can be confidently stated that the future of typographic methods 
lies with the photo-mechanical processes. The invention of the photograph­
ic type-setting machine, the possibility of printing whole editions with 
X-ray radiography, the new cheap techniques of block making, etc., indi­
cate the trend to which every typographer or typophotographer must 
adapt himself as soon as possible .

This mode of modern synoptic communication may be broadly pursued 
on another plane by means of the kinetic process, the film.
