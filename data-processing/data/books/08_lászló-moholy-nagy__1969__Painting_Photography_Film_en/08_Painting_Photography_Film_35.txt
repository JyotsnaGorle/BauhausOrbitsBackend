TYPO PHOTO 
Neither curiosity nor economic considerations alone but a deep human 
interest in what happens in the world have brought about the enormous 
expansion of the news-service: typography, the film and the radio. 
The creative work of the artist, the scientist's experiments, the calcula­
tions of the business-man or the present-day politician, all that moves, all 
that shapes, is bound up in the collectivity of interacting events. The indi­
vidual's immediate action of the moment always has the effect of simul­
taneity in the long term. The technician has his machine at hand: satis­
faction of the needs of the moment. But basically much more: he is the 
pioneer of the new social stratification, he paves the way for the future. 
The printer's work, for example, to which we still pay too little attention · 
has just such a long-term effect: international understanding and its 
consequences. 
The printer's work is part of the foundation on which the new world will 
be built. Concentrated work of organisation is the spiritual result which 
brings all elements of human creativity into a synthesis: the play instinct, 
sympathy, inventions, economic necessities. One man invents printing 
with movable type, another photography, a third screen-printing and 
stereotype, the next electrotype, phototype, tP.e celluloid plate hardened 
by light. Men still kill one another, they have not yet understood how they 
live, why they live; politicians fail to observe that the earth is an entity, 
yet television (Telehor) has been invented: the 'Far Seer'- tomorrow we 
shall be able to look into the heart of our fellow-man, be everywhere and 
yet be alone; illustrated books, newspapers, magazines are printed - in 
n:illio~s. ~he unambiguousness of the real,_ the truth in the ~veryday 
situation Is there for all classes. The hyg1ene of the opt1cal, the 
health of the visible is slowly filtering through.
