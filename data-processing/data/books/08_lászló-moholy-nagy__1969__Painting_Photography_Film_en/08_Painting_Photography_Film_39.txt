I give a schematic drawing to make my meaning quite clear I 
The film about Mr A runs from left to right: birth, course of life. The film 
about the lady 8 runs from the bottom upwards: birth, course of her life. 
The projection surfaces of the two films intersect: love, marriage, etc. The 
two films can then.either proceed by intersecting in translucent sequences 
of events or can run parallel; or a single new film about the two people 
may take the place of the original two. Another film, the third or fourth, 
about Mr C could run simultaneously with the episodes A and 8 from the 
top downwards or from right to left or even in another direction until it 
can properly intersect or merge with the other films, etc. 
Such a scheme will, of course, be just as suitable, if not more so, for nonÂ­
objective light-projections in the manner of the photogram. If colour 
effects are used, still richer creative possibilities will arise.
