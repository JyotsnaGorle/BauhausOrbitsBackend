PHOTOGRAPHY 
Although it has spread enormously, nothing essentially new has been 
discovered in the principle and technique of photography since the pro­
cess was invented. Every innovation since introduced - with the excep­
tion of X-ray photography- has been based on the artistic, reproductive 
concept prevailing in Daguerre's day (c.r83o): reproduction (copy) of 
nature in conformity with the rules of perspective. Every period with a 
distinctive style of painting since then has had an imitative photographic 
manner derived from the painterly trend of the moment (e.g. p. 49).•)

Men discover new instruments, new methods of work; which revolutionise 
their familiar habits of work. Often, however, it is a long time before the 
innovation is properly utilised; it is hampered by the old; the new function 
is shrouded in the traditional form. The creative possibilities of the in­
novation are usually slowly disclosed by these old forms, old instruments 
and fields of creativity which burst into euphoric flower when the inno­
vation which has been preparing finally emerges. Thus for example 
Futurist (static) painting stated the problem of simultaneity of movement, 
the representation of the time impulse- a clear-cut problem which later 
brought about its own destruction; and this was at a time when the film 
was already known but far from being understood. Similarly the painting 
of the Constructivists which paves the way for the development on the 
highest level of reflected light composition such as already exists in 
embryo .. We can also regard- with caution- some of the painters working 
today with representational, objective means (Neo-Classicists and pain­
ters of the 'Neue Sachlichkeit' movement) as pioneers of a new form of
