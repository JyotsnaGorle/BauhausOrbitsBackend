This also puts the role of the controversial easel painting or separate op­
tical structure (in the sense that a book is an autonomous structure with a 
justification for existence independent of nature or architecture) into its 
right perspective. As long, indeed, as man, possessing his sensory facul­
ties, desires optical experiences - one could say: for reasons of self-pre­

harmonies. Until recently, it is true, people thought otherwise. They

the painter's sole mission should be to use his knowledge of colour to un­
derline the intentions of the architect. 
This crass demand challenging the isolated paintings of l' art pour l' art

general consideration, and one which appears to us to have greater vali­
dity: that no material, no field of activity, can be judged from the special 
character of other materials, other fields, and that painting or any optical 
creation has its special laws and missions independently of all others .

Thus for example in painting: instead of judging a work in the light
