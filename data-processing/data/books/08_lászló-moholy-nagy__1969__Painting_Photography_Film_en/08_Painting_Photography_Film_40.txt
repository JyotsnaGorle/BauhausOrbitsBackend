The technical solution to such projections as that of the car or the sketch 
described above is very simple and not at all costly. All that is needed is 
to fit a rotating prism in front of the lens of the film-projector. 
The large projection screen enables us also to repeat a sequence of pic­
tures simultaneously by starting again from the beginning and projecting 
extra prints of the running film-strip on to the screen through projectors 
standing next to one another. In this way the beginning of a movement can 
be shown over and over again as it continues- and is gradually overtaken 
- and novel effects are thereby achieved. 
The realisation of such plans makes new demands upon the capacity of 
our optical organ of perception, the eye, and our centre of perception, the 
brain. The vast development both of technique and of the big cities have 
increased the capacity of our perceptual organs for simultaneous acousti­
cal and optical activity. Everyday life itself affords examples of this: 
Berlin~rs cross the Potsdamer Platz. They are talking, they hear simul-
taneously I 
the horns of the motor-cars, the bells of the trams, the tooting of the 
omnibuses, the halloos of the coachmen, the roar of the underground 
railway, the shouts of the newspaper sellers, the sounds of a loud­
speaker, etc. 
and can keep these different acoustical impressions separate from one 
another. Whereas a provincial, recently found quite disorientated in this 
Platz, was so greatly confused by the number of impressions that he stood as 
though rooted to the spot before an oncoming tram. It is obviously possible 
to construct an analogous situation with optical experiences. 
Analogous, too: that modern optics and acoustics, employed as means of 
artistic creation, can be accepted by and can enrich only those who are 
receptive to the times in which they live.
