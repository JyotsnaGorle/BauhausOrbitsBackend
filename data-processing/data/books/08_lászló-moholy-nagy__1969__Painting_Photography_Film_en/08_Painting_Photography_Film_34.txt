do a great deal more. 
The cutting out, juxtaposing, careful arranging of photographic prints as 
it is done today is a more advanced form (photoplastic, p. ro8-rrz) than 
the early glued photographic compositions (photomontage) of the Dad­
aists (p. ro6-ro7). But not until they have been mechanically improved 
and their development boldly carried forward will the wonderful poten­
tialities inherent in photography and the film be realised.
