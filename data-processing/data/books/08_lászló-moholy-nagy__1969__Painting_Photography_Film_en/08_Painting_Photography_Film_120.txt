No work (of art) can be explained by the sequence of its elements. The totality of the sequence, the sure 
interaction of the smallest parts upon one another and upon the whole are the imponderables of the effect. 
Thus I can explain only some of the elements of this film, so that at least people will not stumble over 
cinematically obvious happenings. 
Aim of the film: to take advantage of the camera, to give it its own optical action, optical arrangement of 
tempo- instead of literary, theatrical action: dynamic of the optical. Much movement, some heightened 
to the point of brutality. 
Individual parts which do not 'logically' belong together are combined either optically, e.g., by interpene­
tration or by placing the individual images in horizontal or vertical strips (so as to make them similar to 
one another), by a diaphragm (e.g., by shutting off one image with an iris-diaphragm and bringing on the 
next from a similar iris-diaphragm) or by making otherwise different objects move in unison, or by asso­
ciative connections. 
As I was reading the corrections for the second edition, I heard reports of two new 
films which seek to realise the same aspirations as those proposed in this chapter 
and the one on Simultaneous Cinema (p. 41 ). Ruttmann's film 'Symphony of the 
Metropolis' shows the rhythm of the movement of a town and dispenses with 
normal 'action'. - In his film 'Napoleon ' Abel Glance uses three film-strips 
running simultaneously side by side.
