The first essential is to clarify the relationship of photography to the 
painting of today and to show that the development of technical means 
has materially contributed to the genesis of new forms in optical creation 
and has split the hitherto indivisible field of optical expression. Until 
p~-Jtography \Vas invented, painting combined within itself the missions 
ui representation and expression in colour. Now since the division, one 
field embraces 
pure colour composition, the other 
representationa I composition. 
COLOUR COMPOSITION: The pure inter-relationships of colours 
and light-values, similar to what we know in music as composition in 
acoustical relationships; that is, the composition of universal systems, 
independent of climate, race, temperament, education, rooted in biologi­
calla\vs ; 
REPRESENTATIONAL COMPOSITION : Relationships of ele­
ments imitatively derived from without, objective elements with asso­
ciative contents, as, in acoustical composition, speech exists side by ~ide 
with music ; this is the composition of systems dependent upon climate, 
race, temperament, education, rooted in association and experience. 
Creative elements which are rooted in biological laws can also be mobilised 
as constructional and compositional auxiliaries•). 
This division is not undoing all that the humanspirithasachievedhitherto; 
on the contrary : the pure forms of expression are being crystallised and 
are becoming more telling in their effect for being autonomous. 
•) Representation is not identical with nature or a slice of nature. E.g., when we seek to fix 
a fantasy or a dream the results are equally representational. 
In the hands of an original artist representation becomes creation, otherwise it remains mere 
rep~rtage. The introduction and spread of colour photography, a development which has 
had a very short history, in no way alters this situation.
