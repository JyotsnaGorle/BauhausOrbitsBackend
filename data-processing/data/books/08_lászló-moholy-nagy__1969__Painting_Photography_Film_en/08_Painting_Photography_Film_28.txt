If we desire a revaluation in the field of photography so that it can be 
used productively, we must exploit the light-sensitivity of the photograph­
ic (silver bromide) plate: fixing upon it light phenomena (moments from 
light-displays) which we have ourselves composed (with contrivances of 
mirrors or lenses, transparent crystals, liquids, etc.). We may regard 
astronomical, X-ray and lightning photographs all as forerunners of this 
type of composition (p. 63 to 72). 
duce existing acoustical phenomena. The sound vibrations which have to be reproduced 
are scratched by a needle on a wax plate and later transposed back into sound from a 
pressing from that plate with the aid of a membrane. 
Expansion of the apparatus for productive purposes might make it possible for scratches to 
be made in the wax plate by the person himself without mechanical external agency (p. 62); 
these would, when reproduced, give an effect of sound, which would offer without new in­
struments and without orchestra a new way of generatj.ng sound (new sounds which do 
not yet exist and new sound relationships) and thus help to bring about a change in the 
concept of music and in compositional possibilities. (See my articles in 'De Stijl' 1922 No.7, 
in 'Der Sturm' VII/1923 and in 'Broom'[New York] March 1923, 'Anbruch' [Vienna] 1926.)
