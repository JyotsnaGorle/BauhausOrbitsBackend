INTRODUCTION 
I . 
In this book I seek to identify the ambiguities of present-day optical crea­
tion. The means afforded by photography play an important part therein, 
though it is one which most people today still fail to recognise: extending 
the limits of the depiction of nature and the use of light as a creative 
agent: chiaroscuro in place of pigment. 
The camera has offered us amazing possibilities, which we are only just 
beginning to exploit. The visual · image has been expanded and even the 
modern lens is no longer tied to the narrow limits of our eye; no manual 
means of representation '(pencil, brush, etc.) is capable of arresting frag­
ments of the world seen like this; it is equally impossible for manual means 
of creation to fix the quintessence of a movement; nor should we regard 
the ability of the lens to distort- the view from below, from above, the 
oblique view- as in any sense merely negative, for it provides an impartial 
approach, such as our eyes, tied as they are to the laws of association, do 
not give;. and from another point of view: the delicacy of the grey effects 
produces a sublimated value, the differentiation of which can transcend 
its own sphere of influence and even benefit colour composition. But when 
we have enumerated these uses, we are still far from having exhausted the 
possibili_ ties in the field. We are . only beginning to exploit them; for -
although photography is already over a hundred years old- it is only in 
recent years that the course of development has allowed us to see beyond 
the specific instance and recognise the creative consequences. Our vision 
has only lately developed sufficiently to grasp these connections.
