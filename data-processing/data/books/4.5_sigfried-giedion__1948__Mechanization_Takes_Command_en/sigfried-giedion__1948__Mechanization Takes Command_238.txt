113. '1\laking Cans for Use in Packing the Meat,' Chicago, 1878, (Frank Leslie's 
Illustrated Newspaper, 12 October 1878) 
Swift is said to have crossed the Atlantic over twenty times before finding an 
outlet for his products in England. How far organization was basic to the enter­
prise may perhaps appear more clearly from a single incident than from long 
descriptions. When Swift engineered, with striking success, his 'Chicago dressed 
beef' in New York, especial care was tsken, as Harper's Weekly then explained, 
to statiou each refrigerator car with 'its door ... opposite to that of the storage 
building, and the railwa~ s [overhead monorails] of the two are connected, and 
the meat is easily transferred to the storage room, which is of the same tempera­
ture as the car, without loss of time and withont being removed from the hook on 
42 
which it was hung when killed.'
