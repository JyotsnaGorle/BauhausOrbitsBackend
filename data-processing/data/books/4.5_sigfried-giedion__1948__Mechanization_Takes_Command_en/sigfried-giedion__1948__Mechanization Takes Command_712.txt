PLIJ~BINO IN A FLAT 
491. Chicago Apartment-House Plumbing, 1891. The Chicago apartrnen.tlwuses of the 'nineties, which in­
corporated the rrwsl advanced standards, already slww the futures aligned aWng one wall, but not in the most 
compact way. The baihtnb is still set against the long wall. Later it will be turned 90°, as will the toilet. 
(Industrial Chi'.cago, 1891) 
Like Pulhnan's sleeping car The Pioneer (1865), this markerl an important 
step towarrl the rlemocratization of comfort, when a mirldle-class hotel was 
built around a standard living unit of bedroom, hath, and closet. In Europe, 
even today, the combination of a room with private bath borders on luxury. 
Putting into practice the maxim 'a bath to every bedroom' immediately influ­
enced the whole plan (figs. 492-4), anrl was as decisive for the bote! as the 
organization of the bath and kitchen for the plan of the private house. At 
once the standard American layout harl appeared: The bath is a cell and an 
appendage to the bedroom.
