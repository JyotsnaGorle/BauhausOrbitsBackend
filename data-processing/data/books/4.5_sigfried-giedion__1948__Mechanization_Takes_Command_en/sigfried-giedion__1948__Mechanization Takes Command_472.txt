for sleeping ears but for 'improvements for railway car seat and couch.' The 
emergence of today 's standard types followed in the period 1854 to 1865, along­
side the most effervescent period of inventiveness in American patent furniture. 
The convertible cars offered only the barest comfort. Traveling in them was 
hardly a pleasure. In the topmost berth the passenger lay so close to the ceiling 
that he could not sit upright; and in the bottommost, so close to the floor that 
he could look out on the soles of passing feet. But transportation in those early 
days was not an everyday matter, and one sacrificed convenience as when shelter­
ing in a mountain hut. The cabin, denominated 'stateroom,' which Charles 
Dickens occupied on his crossing to America in 1842 (fig. 282) was abnost as 
72 
austere as the American sleeping car of 1847 (fig. 283). This sleeping car of 
the Baltimore and Ohio, with its lath frame that folded to the wall at daytime, 
might do, but only as a makeshift. 'To tell you that these beds are perfectly 
comfortable would be a lie, but one is thankful to find them such as they are 
73 
and to be able to pass a pretty tolerable night.' 
This sleeping car of 184.7 had close ties with the sleeping accommodations on 
American canal boats of the time. Nathaniel Hawthorne suggests, with the 
!,'face of his language, what life was like in a canal boat's cabin --living quarters, 
dining room, and dormitory in one. 'The crimson curtain being let down between 
the ladies and gentlemen'- as he calls it, 'the sexual division of the boat'­
'the cabin became a bedchamber for twenty persons, who were laid on shelves 
one above another. . . . Forgetting that my berth was hardly so wide as a 
74 
coffin, I turned suddenly over, and fell like an avalanche on the floor ... .' 
In 1854, three years after the appearance of the convertible railroad seat, 
75 
the United States Patent Office granted the first American sleeping-car patent 
76 
(fig. 284). An English patent (1852) mentioned in the literature of the sub­
ject has noiliing to do with the sleeping car. It attempted- in scarcely satis­
factory fashion - to double the seating capacity of the car at the expense of 
headroom: a double-decker. A glance at the sketch made by the Buffalo inventor 
of 1854 shows that he took the reversible seat as his point of departure. Instead 
of swinging the back rest through the customary 180 degrees, he swung it only 
through 90 degrees, up to a horizontal position in mid air, where it was made 
fast. He carried his back rests higher than the usual, 'so arranging the backs 
of contiguous seats that they may meet and remain in the same horizontal
