Toward !he end of the 'eighties eleetricity came

Food cooked in it i.~ said fo hmw an 'electrical

The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 outdid in one respect the Eiffel Tower and 
Halle des Machines of its immediate Parisian forerunner: It gave a display of 
electrical illumination such as had never before been witnessed. A number of 
industrialists had spiritedly begun electrical experimentation in various direc­
tions. Included in the exhibition wa• a 'Model Electric Kitchen' (fig. 365), 
having a small electrified range, electric broiler, and electric kettles. 
Just as demonstration kitchens bad been set up to bolster confidence in the 
gas range of 1850, the same strategy was used four decades later to popularize 
electrical cooking. The Algonquin Club in Boston is recorded as having set 
up a demonstration restaurant for twenty persons, where a full dinner was 
cooked (from the bread to fish, sirloin roast, and coffee), the' cost of fuel' amount­
56 
ing to barely over a cerrt per person. But this dinner seems to have proved 
no more persuasive than the electrically cooked banquet held in 1895 in horror 
of the Lord Mayor of London. There followed an incubation period (1890-
1910). The electrified ranges that then made their appearance had the same 
aspect as the contemporary gas stoves. 'Between 1909 and 1919,' a
