Full Mechanization: Bread on the Production Line 
Many of the machines by which the mass manufacture of bread and the mn­
tinuous production line became possible were first devised in Europe. Bread 
baking is a complicated craft. Although kneading machines and other labor­
saving devices were used long before. nowhere was the passage to full mechaniza­
tion more hesitant than in the food products. 
Even in England, where this mechanization had its beginnings, 'bread factories 
are less numerous than small bakeries. After 1900. the proportion is 80 : 1 in

favor of the ::nnal1 bakerif's.' D Since that time, in comparison with America, 
things have remained much as they were. 
Such is certainly the case on the Continent, even in countries with a high 
living standard. Their small bakeries are largely equipped with mechanical
