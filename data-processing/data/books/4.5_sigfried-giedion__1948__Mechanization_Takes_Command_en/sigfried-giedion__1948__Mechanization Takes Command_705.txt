483. Standardization and Trimmings: One Hat, Many Effects. By different trimmings, a standard model 
~adapted lo various tastes and ages. Hals, houses, or baOtrooms, all had to be pseudo--expressions of individ­

dissolved into cushions. Again and again the catalogues and handbooks of the 
'eighties and 'nineties advise that the plumber's duty is to carry out the archi­
tect's wishes, both in the matter of form and of ornamentation. Thus tbe 'hooded 
baths,' showers, and enclosures for the English bathroom of 1888 (fig. 478) can 
be made 'in various woods to accord with the surroundings or the design' as

well as 'modified to suit architect's requirements.' The prices of these trap­
pings attest the value that was attached to them: the enclosure alone, without 
bath, shower, or plumbing, cost some £60. In tbe absence of an enclosure, one 
bad to be satisfied with many-colored painting. The standard models were 
covered with a diversity of ornaments in variegated styles, which in the 'eighties 
and 'nineties must have had a hypnotic effect on the consumer, similar to the 
streamlining of everyday objects at a later time. Hence the makers were unstint­
ing of polychrome reproductions. Even in 1900, Twyford's Twentieth Century 
Catalogue carries tubs and washbasins in identical models adorned in alternative 
ways (fig. 484). One treated the bathtub in the sa)lle spirit as those hats (fig. 
483) manufactured in a standard model, which by variegation of the trinunings 
can be made hemming to various ages and various tastes.
