for lightness and simplicity of joining. But it already announced new tendencies, 
with its free span of canvas, forming seat and resilient back rest, its greater 
reliance on cantilever elements, and its use of standardized wooden sections, 
with a view to serial production. 
The basic principles of the tubular chair were already present. Walter Gro­
