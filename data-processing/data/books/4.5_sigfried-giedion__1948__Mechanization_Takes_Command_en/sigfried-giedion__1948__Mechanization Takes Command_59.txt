21. Serial Production by Handicraft Workers in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Converting Red 
Copper. 1764. This engraving entitled 'The Artisans at Work' is from the Descriptions des arts et metiers, 
one of our mo.9t valuable sources for eighteenth-century mechanizalian. The large flal trip hammers beat with 
varying force and speed as the volume of water falling on the wheel is greater or less. Artisans shape the metal 
into strips, plates, or vessels. (Duhamel du Monceau, L'Artde convertir le cuivre rouge. Descriptions des 
arts ct metiers, vol. V, pL. X, Paris, 1764) 
THE HAND 
BEYOND enumeration are the domains of mechanization and all the techniques 
that have gone to build up the life we know today. But the method that fonns 
the basis of all mechanization is amazingly simple. 
The human hand is a prehensile tool, a grasping instrument. It can seize, 
hold, press, pull, mold with ease. It can search and feel. Flexibility and articu足
lation are its key words. 
The triple-articulated fingers, tbe wrist, the elbow, tbe shoulders, and, on 
occasion, the trunk and legs heighten the flexibility and adaptability of the hand. 
Muscles and tendons determine how it will seize and hold the object. Its sensi足
tive skin feels and recognizes materials. The eye steers its movement. But 
vital to all this integrated work is the mind that governs and the feelings that 
lend it life. The kneading of bread; the folding of a cloth; the moving of brush 
over canvas: each movement has its root in the mind. For all the compli足
may rise, to one thing it is poorly suited: 
cated tasks to which this organic tool 
automatization. In its very way of performing movement, the band is ill-fitted 
to work with mathematical precision and without pause. Each movement 
depends on an order that the brain must constantly repeat. It wholly contra足
dicts the organic, based on growth and change, to suffer antomatization.
