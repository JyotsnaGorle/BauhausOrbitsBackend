250. Adjustable Barber Chair, 1867. Such simple, ti/Ung barber chairs remained mod common down io fl!.e 
late 1880's. The mm;able chair section can be set at either of two angles on the Hllrd planes of the base, the 
customer resting his feel on a footstool often as high as a praying desk. (Adverfl:sem.enf) 
251. Barber Chair, 1880. The tilling--chair principle still prevails; separate /DOt rest. (Catalogue Thea. A. 
Kochs, Chicago) 
tilting was known than by dividing the chair into three elements, the chair, the 
base, and between them a middle plane." (fig. 248). The body of the chair 
would tilt backwards hy means of rack and gear, and forwards by raising the 
middle plane. 
Soon tilting is more simply achieved: the chair comprises two parts, the chair 
proper and the base on which it pivots. The rear of the base offers an inclined 
plane; the inclination of the chair is fixed by the plane on which it rests. Cited 
to the advantage of this chair in 1867 is that it 'causes the person to sit up straight 
26 
while having the hair <lressed, or lean back while being shaved' (fig. 250). 
For decades these ' tilting chairs,' for whose mobility devices of every sort were 
proposed, formed a category of their own in the American patent lists. 
In the 'seventies there was no Jack of complex devices that enabled the seat 
and the hack rest to he reversed in one motion before the next customer took 
place in the chair. Throughout the potent-furniture movement the aim was 
greater adjustahility and mobility, and the parts came to be ever more flexibly 
interconnecte<l. As complicated as the harher chair becomes in the course of 
its development, the main problem always remains the sante: easy transition
