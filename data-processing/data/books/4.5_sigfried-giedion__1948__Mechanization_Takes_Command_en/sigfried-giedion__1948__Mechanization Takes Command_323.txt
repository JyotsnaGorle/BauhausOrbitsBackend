of the Greeks as the silks and laces of the ladies of the French court are from the 
austerity of the peplos. Typologically speaking, it was the return of a forgotten 
standard: To create a supportfortbe body that would allow highly relaxed posture. 
A red-figured bowl of the frl'tb century, on which Palamedes and Persephone 
are depicted, seats tbe goddess, scepter in hand, with that fully relaxed posture 
acquired by loug breeding and training of the body (fig. 169). Posture and chair 
are one. The cushionless seat slopes gently backward and the broad back rest 
carries up to above shoulder height, enfolding the body in its curve. From the 
backward inclination of the trunk and the forward extension of the feet, at 
rest on the footstool- a custom acquired from the Egyptians- there emaÂ­
nates the same atmosphere of serenity and natural poise as from a Greek temple. 
In the eighteenth century, this sitting comfort developed in the direction of ease, 
luxury, and flexibility in posture. The curved, upholstered backs introduced hy 
the French arc the last term of a slow development from the late Gothic on.
