The slender volume, American Agricultural Implements (Chicago, 1894), in 
which they were collected by R. L. Ardrey, and to which we turn again and 
again, serves as a V asari for the key years of American agriculture. 
The mechanical knotfer: No device for tying knots was available from the 
textile industry. The idea presented itself of using twine to hind the sheaves,

hnt no satisfactory solution came to hand. The self-binding harvester was 
a burning problem of mechanization. C. W. Marsh gives some insight into the 
extent of the ill-fated attempts, when he reports: 'It was twenty-five years 
before they had become perfect in design and operation so that they conld he 
manufactured far general use; and during this time as mnch capital was lost 
in fruitless efforts as there is invested in the industry at the present time.' " 
The stiff material, wire, offered fewer difficulties, and at the beginning of the 
'seventies there emerged a workable automat that secured the sheaves by means

By 1851, a patent attorney, well versed in agricultural machinery, together with several inventors 
took out a patent on a reaper, protecting everything that they thought of possible interest in the future 
dewJopment of the reaper. Correctly anticipating the next step, they were mainly concerned with the 
sheaf-binding mechanism.
