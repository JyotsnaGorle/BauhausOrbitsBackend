has room enough to open the washstand, the clothes closet, and the toilet closet 
in the opposite wall. 'By raising the cushion top of the seat, toilet facilities are 
afforded.' The roomette is not an actual room. It is combiuation furniture 
inside which a traveler can move. Wheu unfolded, the hed ahsorhs the seat 
areas and the entire floor space. 
This hed, which when folded away becomes part wall and part upholstered 
back rest, follows from the same principle as the wardrobe bedstead of 1859 
(fig. 267). Operating in both eases is the law of the transmutability of plane 
surfaces. 
The roomette is one of the few convertible pieces in which the tradition of the 
'fifties has survived to the present day. The reason lies in its belonging to an 
institution that from its earliest phase has developed without break- the 
sleeping ear.
