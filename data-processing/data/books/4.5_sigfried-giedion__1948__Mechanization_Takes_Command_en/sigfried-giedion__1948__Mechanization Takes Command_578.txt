392. French Automatic Washing Machine by Duvoir, 1837. Washing machines employing fhe natural 
circulation of steam and boiling water were just made for industrial use in French textile bleacheries of the 
1830's. 'Steam is formed in the boiler and, pressing upon the liquid, causes it to mount through the ascender 
tube which projects i1 uniformly over the surface of the linen.' In the 1940's fully automatic was!u:N for the 
home employ the same principle, spurting 'geysers' of water through the fabric (fig. 404). (J. B. Dumas, 
TraitC de chimie appliquee aux arts, Paris, 18,!7) 
James T. King's cylinder washing machine of 1851 marks the inauguration of 
automatic laundering. But, it should not be overlooked, such ideas had long

heen in the air. An American patent of 1831, which has survived the Patent 
Office fire in the shape of a handwritten specification, shows the inventor already 
working with two concentric cylinders. The water is admitted to 'an outer 
cylinder ... constructed so as to be water tight,' while 'the open cylinder is 
made to revolve upon iron gudgeons.' Here too steam was used in the cleaning, 
but was generated in a separate cauldron. 
FALTERING INTRODUCTION 
The first American washing-machine patent dates from the year 1305. From 
then on efforts to perfect it into a practical appliance were ahuost unceasing. 
Its introduction came about falteringly. Over a hundred years elapsed before 
the mechanization of laundering took effect in the average household. Despite 
the many patents, it is only from around 1860 that we can speak of a washing-
