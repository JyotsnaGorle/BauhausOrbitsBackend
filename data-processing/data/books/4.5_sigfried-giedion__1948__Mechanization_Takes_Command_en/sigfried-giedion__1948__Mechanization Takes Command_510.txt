The Mobile Tubular Chair 
A material so abstract as steel tubing might seem refractory to personal 
handling. Yet in practice the different countries develop<il different forms of 
expression. France too made its contribution between 1925 and 1929. 
Superficially viewed, from the time of Napoleon I on, France is full of inner 
contradictions. On tbe one hand it is the country of obstinate academism in 
all artistic matters. On the other, the course of painting and construction in 
the nineteenth century is inconceivable without France. Whatever creative 
impulses came into tbe open did so against the will of tbe majority and in direct 
conflict with the ruling taste. Tbat they were expressed at all was owing to 
the vigor of a way of life that France never allowed to be overwhehned by 
mechanization.
