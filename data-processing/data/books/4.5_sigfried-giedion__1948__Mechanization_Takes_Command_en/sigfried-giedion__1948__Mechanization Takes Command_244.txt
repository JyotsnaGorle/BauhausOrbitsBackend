117. Apparatus for Catching and Suspending Hogs. 1882. Jlere the living animal must be introduced into 
the 'disassembly' line. From the 1370's on when stunning was found too slow, devices were proposed to hoist 
the hog to the overhead rail without struggle: 'The hog Mads as a deco,y for the others, and much lime and labor 
are thus saved. The brake is manipulated to allow the irap D to Rlowly descend until the hogs are completely 
s.mpended, when they slide off on the bar [( to the place where they are to be killed.' ( U. S. Patent 252,112, 
10 January 1882)
