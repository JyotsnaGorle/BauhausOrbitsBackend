The eighteenth centnry had witnessed early efforts to extend graphic repre­

same method. The drawing of contour lines on maps was attempted, according 
to Marey, as far back as the sixteenth centur), but on!) becdllle current in post­
Napoleonic times. Marcy also mentions an eighteenth-century attempt to 
represent the successive phases of the horse's gait (fig. ll).
