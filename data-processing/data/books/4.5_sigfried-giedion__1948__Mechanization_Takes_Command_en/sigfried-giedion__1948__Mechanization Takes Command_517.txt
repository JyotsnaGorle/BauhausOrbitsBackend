332. Americ.an Bent Plywood Chair, 1874. Cross Section. The chair is made of three .~ections of laminated 
wood. 'Obtained by pressing several layers of veneer into forms of corresponding shape. If three layers of 
veneer are used, the grain of the middle one runs crosswise to that of the outer layers. The elastict"ly and strength 
of the veneers are thereby considerably increased.' (U.S. Patent 148,350, 10 March 1874)

slabs or houses on stilts, houses surrounded by air. One was .drawn to things 
that seemed to defeat gravitation. This emotional need is as innate to our own 
tirae as the buttress to the Gothic and the undulating wall to the Baroque. 
In material, cantilever chairs were not confined to steel tubing. The interest 
in new techniques led to cantilever chairs of wood. The irapulse came from a 
borderland of our civilization, Finland. There lumbering and woodworking 
form the very basis of life. Finland abounds in birch forest, and the birch tree 
yields a soft pliable wood whose potentialities had yet to be grasped. Many 
are the lands endowed with a generous wood supply, yet not all give rise to a
