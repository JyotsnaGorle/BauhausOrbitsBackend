369. The Electric Range Popularlzt,-d: 
Mail~Order Catalogue, 1930. The patiern 
of the cm;t~i'ron cooking stove is still evideni. 
The mail-order catalogue forms a yearly in~ 
dex to American civilization. Any article 
in its pages has entered large-scale producÂ­
tion .. (Montgomery Ward and Co. catalogue, 
1930) 
Yet for 1919 this optimism was perhaps too rosy. Indeed, five years later a 
long series of articles on the electric kitchen for private houses tells us that 
disappointments were not unknown. 'Some people who tried electric cooking 
gave it up again on account of the excessive repair hills and the inconvenience 
connected with the burning out of elements. This shows that there must he 
many defects still mnnected with electric moking appliances and room for 
5
considerable improvement.' s 
About the development of the electric types, there is little more to he said 
than for the gas range. They were patterned on the gas range of the type already 
mentioned, the console raised on legs, with oven and broiler above the moking 
top. Until 1930, when the electric range's popularity began, the gas range 
held the lead, and was apparently first to attain the 'table-top' form, standard 
today. From then on, as the larger electrical firms take to selling entire kitchen 
units and undertake their own investig-ation of the work process, the electrical 
range comes to the fore. This is in the mid 'thirties. Now it has a gleaming 
whiLe enamel casing, and the oven cannot be distinguished from the utensil 
drawers. It has merged with the kitchen. And even more clearly than where 
there is a visible flame, one can see how the kitchen of today developed from the 
serving pantry, the room with continuous working surfaces where, in large 
middle-class households, domestics added finishing touches.
