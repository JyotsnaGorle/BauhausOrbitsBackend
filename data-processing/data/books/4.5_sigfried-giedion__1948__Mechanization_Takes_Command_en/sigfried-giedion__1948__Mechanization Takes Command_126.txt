a third step, leading toward mastery of symbolic language free of atavistic 
reference. 
In Joan Mira's painting, around 1924, appear signs, numbers, and serpentine 
curves. Their use is hesitant at first, haphazard and Dadaistic. Toward 1930 
they gain in power (figs. 55, 57). The faculty awakens in Miro to endow color, 
both by the shape it fills, and by its relation to the whole image, with a luminons 
quality bordering on the magical. Miro's forms, which used to flutter lightly 
like paper streamers through space, take on weight and definition. What was 
a boldness in 1921, when Klee lithographed his 'Queen of Hearts,' is now taken 
for granted. Personages, animals, erotic constellations, turn into signs, motion 
forms imbued with the force of symbols; and this artist of the post-Kleeian gen­
eration seems almost predestined to translate them into murals. 
By signs and forms, the artists express the unknown within us, to interpret 
the winding paths of the mind as really and efficiently as motion-curves serve 
scientific management. 
Both lie equally rooted within us, for movement and the symbols of move­
ment become of one flesh with our being.
