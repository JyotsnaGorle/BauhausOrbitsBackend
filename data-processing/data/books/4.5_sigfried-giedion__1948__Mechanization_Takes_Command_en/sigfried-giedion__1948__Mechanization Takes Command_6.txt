I mentioned the primitive conditions under which this book had to be done, 
as an apology for its apparent incompleteness. 1 wish, however, to express my 
deep gratitude for all the personal help I received from many sides, and I wish 
to mention particularly the historian Herbert C. Kellar, Director of the 1\fcCor足
mick Historical Society, Chicago; of industrialists like C. F. Frantz, President of 
the Apex Electrical Mfg. Co., Cleveland; of Mr. A. W. Robertson, Chairman of 
the Board of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Pittsburgh; of 1\fr. William 
Eitner, of the General Electric 1\ffg. Co.; and of many others mentioned in the text. 
I am deeply indebted to Mr. Martin James who, with never tiring care, pre足
pared the English version in collaboration with the author, and to Miss Lotte 
Labus for her constilllt help and the editing of the index, which will prove a valu足
able help in interrelating facts and notions. Mr. Herbert Bayer and Mrs. 
Elisabeth Wolff assisted me with the layout. 
Research and manus<Tipt, with the exception of the conclusion, which my 
friend Mr. J. M. Richards of London kindly corrected, were finished during my 
second stay in the United States, from December 1941 to December 1915. Last 
but not least, I had the precious advice of my dear friend, the late L. Moholy足
Nagy. 
Special tribute is due to the Oxford University Press and its staff, who achieved 
the production of this book, which proved harder than we had foreseen. 
To facilitate the reading, special care was taken in the choice and the layout 
of illustrations. Captions are provided in such a way as to convey the broad 
outline independently of and simultaneously with the text.
