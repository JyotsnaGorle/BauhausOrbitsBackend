Eighteen1h-century endeavor, early and late, used spiral springs for purely 
technical purposes, either to take up and buffer impact (carriage springs), or 
to reciprocate impact (chamber horse). The owner of the chamber horse rode 
a hard leather-covered board and did not use the springs' resiliency to further 
his comfort.

In 1826 Samuel Pratt took out a patent for a spring chair; now the scat, 
fabric covered and with spiral springs, is used as a cushion and aims to promote 
comfort. But even here the resiliency mainly serves as a shock-absorber: the 
first spring-upholstered chair was invented for seasick persons. 'Conceived as 
a swinging apparatus,' says Pratt, 'the object of my invention is to construct an 
elastic and swiTI{Jing seat, to be used on shipboard for the purpose of preventing 
88 
the unpleasant effects of seasickness' (fig. 225).
The 'cushion,' which spiral springs make elastic, is for this inventor a mere 
accessory. We may note that the cushion has a 'swinging frame, made of 
wrought iron, upon which the seat is secured.' (This may explain why Dervilliers 
fauteuils around a frame of iron.)
