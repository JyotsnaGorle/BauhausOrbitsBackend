Chauvelin's neighbor, Josephine Beauharnais, the First Consul's wife, having 
bought the old castle of Mabnaison (1798), became dissatisfied with the archi­
tects who were to remodel it, She saw Percier and Fontaine's near-by renova­
tion; Isabey, the society painter, introduced them. She appears to have heen 
delighted hy their work and entrusted Mabnaison to their care. Another cir­
eumstance may have moved her to do so. Madame Recamier, the society 
beauty, had just furnished a bedroom in the antique style (1798), showing how 
well its delicateness might grace a woman's heauty (fig. 195). 
Lonis Marie Berthault, a pupil of Percier's, carried out the design, hut under 
the direction of the two architects. Indeed, every detail of ornament, the painted 
drapery with fringes, betrays Percier's hand. Josephine's hed, like Madame 
Recamier's, was ornamented head and foot with swans. Josephine preferred 
Mabnaison above all other places, lived there to the end (1814), and died there 
in the swan-bed that Percier had designed for her.
