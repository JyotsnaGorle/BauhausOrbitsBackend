fascinated the minds of inventors almost as much as did the solution of the revolv­
ing-pistol prohlem in the late 'thirties, when the most extravagant solutions were 
proposed for the automatic change of hullets. 
Of the multitude of answers offered for the lock prohlem, we shall isolate one 
which was developed hy Linus Yale, Jr. It carne ahout with the great flood of 
inventions of the 'sixties, and may stand as a symhol of the transition to mechan­
ical production in lockrnaking. Minor details of Yale's lock have changed with 
time, hut, as far as the principle is concerned, his fmal solution of the lock proh­
lem was found from the heginning. 
We are choosing this lock for discussion hecause in it the principle of the hand­
made lock is completely changed. It translates ancient as well as recent tradi­
tions into terms of elahorate mechanical production. 
This interplay of things stemming from Antiquity with more recent dwelop­
mcnts has a counterpart in the art of our day. The direct expressions of quite 
diverse periods, from caveman painting to African Negro sculpture, has helped 
modern artists find a pathway to our own suhconscious life.
