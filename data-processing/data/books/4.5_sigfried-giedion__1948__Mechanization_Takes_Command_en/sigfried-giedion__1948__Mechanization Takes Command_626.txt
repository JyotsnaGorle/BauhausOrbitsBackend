industry had no financial incentive to treat the kitchen as a unit 'where the 
equipment is all related.' 
The organized work-process kitchen around 1935, known as streamline 
kitchen, translated the thinking of some American women into terms of indus­
trial production. Standardization of its components is the mark of the stream­
line kitchen. Its elements are sold, preferably in sets, by the large corporations 
or the mail-order houses (fig. 435). These sections are variously combinable 
and readily fit with all other sections of the unit. The range, the sink, and 
cabinets may be placed along one wall, two walls (L-shape), or three walls

have applied the principles elaborated in the eighty years since Catherine Beecher. They make appealing sales

( U-sbape). A trend toward standardization and combinability can be observed 
in American range-makiug at a surprisingly early season. One 'air-tight cook­
ing range' of 1847, especially intended for hotels, ships, or hospitals, was built, 
as its advertisement sho"s (flg. 433), of standardized range sections, which 
could be added end to end, up to the desired length. Its parts were easily inter-
