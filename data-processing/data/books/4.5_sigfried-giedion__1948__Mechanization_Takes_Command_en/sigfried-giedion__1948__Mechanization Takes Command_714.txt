495. American Compact Bathroom, 1908. Around 1908 catalogues show the compact bathroom as the new 
hotels were beginning to install it. Fixtures are still supplied from different walls; the tub is still raised on feet. 
its position along the short wall contrasts with what was hitherto normal. (Catalogue, L. Wolff Co., Chicago)

THE COMPACT BATHROOM 
The rigid layout of the bath, basin, and toilet, and their compression within 
a minimum space, was what America called the compact bathroom. The pre­
requisite for this, the aligning of all fixtures along one wall, had long been an­
ticipated in the United States. The bathroom of George Vanderbilt's Fifth 
Avenue house, 1885 (fig. 476), with its proudly displayed pipes and small inter­
vals between the fixtures, already seems to announce the compact bathroom. 
Chicago, in so many ways America's boldest testing ground of the late 'eighties, 
was also at the forefront in the comfort of the dwelling. Its apartment houses 
- a still unexploreAl development - with their triple 'Chicago windows,' no 
way betrayed the fear of light that darkened European houses at that time. 
Here the immediate forerunners of the compact bathroom arc also to be found. 
I nduslrial Chicago, that indispensable source for the period, devotes one of its 
chapters to recent advances in plmnbing. The page 'plumbing in a flat' (fig.
