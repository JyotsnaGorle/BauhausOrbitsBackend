Nowhere does this American democratic impulse show forth more clearly 
than in the strivings of the 'fifties, in the efforts to make the common railroad 
seat adjustable to posture at all moments and even to make it transformable 
into a reclining chair or a couch. The stimulus came from the principle that 
each passenger is entitled to an equal place and an equal comfort. For this 
reason the period admitted but one travel class, a tradition still alive in the 
American coach class. 
After the Civil War a change set in, with the appearance of Pulbnan and 
luxury in travel. It was still a democratization of comfort; yet, silently and 
without labels, it introduced a multiclass system in America. As time went on, 
increasing differentiation tended further and further in the direction of luxury. 
The second source behind the comfort of American travel is the mechanizaÂ­
tion of furniture. Its elements are the convertible seat and the folding bed. 
They make possible the conversion of day quarters into night quarters, of living 
room into bedroom. The convertible seat and the folding bed belong to the 
family of patent furniture- to that furniture which is adjustable to posture 
hy virtue of its mobility and to multiple function by ils powers of mechanical 
metamorphosis.
