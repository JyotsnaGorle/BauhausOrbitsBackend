From Mart Starn and Mies van der Robe, the cantilever chair retnrned to 
:\Iarcel Breuer. He took over Mart Starn's more compact formulation with 
its upright supports, improved the construction, and gave to the tnhnlar chair 
the shape that has spread far and wide. 
During this period, from 1925 to 1929, England was slnmhering as if its re­
formers had never existed; while America had given itself over heart and mind 
to the cnlt of antiqnes and to their imitators. Frank Lloyd Wright meant 
no more to the pnhlic than did the Modern Movement as a whole. The honses 
and interiors for which the struggle was being so bitterly waged on the Conti­
nent were non-existent so far as England and America cared. In the 'thirties, 
the Americans manufactured cantilever tubular chairs in Breuer's definitive 
formulation, mass-producing them on a great scale and at a fraction of the 
European cost. Like other contemporary furniture, the)' were not allowed to 
enter the drawing room. They were used in barber shops and mainly as kitchen 
equipment. 
And )let the idea of the cantilever chair has closer ties with America than with 
any other country. But one has to go back to the patent-furniture movement.
