444. Itincrar~ of the Rcwmer<Hion J':ypCf\, In this map we 
have lenfaiiu;ly traced the path of the di.fferenl type.~ of regenera­
tion_ From Central Asia the archetype-- vapor or hot-air bath­
spread in ancient times to Russia, Syria, lhc Greek worhl. This 
type was probably fll'sl elaborated technically in the Nile Della 
during the Ptolemaic Period. In the fir.~t centnry n.c. the Roman 
Thermae, a crossing of archetype with the Greek gymrw.sium, 
spread with the expanding Empire. It was in Syria, in the third 
century A.D., that the Roman Thermae- marching easl- mel 
the archel,vpe and were transformed info whal later became lhe 
Islamic bath, a type that persit;led until the influ:c of mechaniza· 
lion. ()H. Ecochard and S. Giedion) 
baths (fig. 446) were not provincial simplifications, but descendants of the 
original type, absorbed aud adapted to Greco-Homan living habits. The arche­
type will prove the stronger. Detail by detail the early Arabiau conquerors 
of the eighth ceutury will take them over, as comparison of a third-century 
Syrian bath with the caliph's bath at Kusair' Amra aud other eighth-century 
Syrian installations graphically shows.
