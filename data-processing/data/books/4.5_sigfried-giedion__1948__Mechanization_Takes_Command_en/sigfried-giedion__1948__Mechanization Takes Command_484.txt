to become a table and in which both work tools and kitchenware are carried; " 
or a proposal to 'connect two camp stools together by means of rods between 
92 
which is extended a piece of sacking.' The development proceeds parallel 
with that of the sleeping car. lt matures with surprising rapidity and draws 
to an early close." 
Comparison of Napoleon III's three-room tent (1859) with an American 
94 
combination camp utensil of 1864 reveals the extraordinary rate of progress. 
This too is a camp chest (fig. 302). Its size is that of the regular portmante"'u, 
2' square by 2'4" high. It is made up entirely of combination furniture- a 
full set. Opened, it becomes an easy chair or a lounge. Within its coffer-like 
base there is room for a drawer that contains not only washing gear, but also 
'cooking and table utensils' and ' an anny cooking stove such as is in use.' 
Moreover, a collapsible frame may be annexed, forming a second chair or bed. 
This can continue in serial fashion. The armrests are extensible, allowing a 
table leaf to be laid a~Toss them. To one side of the lounge a table surface is 
at hand. 
Beside these American field chests with their cleverly compressed house­
keeping, the European camp furniture of the period takes on a primitive aspect; 
as markedly as -by the standards of the ruling taste-- American furniture 
for the drawing room seemed primitive beside the luxury appointments of the 
Continent. Like the sleeping car in its initial phase, this American camp funu­
ture was directed not to the few but to the many. 
The Hammock 
Even so simple an article as the hammock is drawn into the American patent 
furniture movement and completely transformed. To recline in this hovering, 
suspended network, made fast only at each end, comes close to the idea of 
mobility as realized in the adjustable seating of the period. We shall not be 
surprised to find variations on the hammock arousing greatest interest just as 
the patent furniture reaches its peak, during the 'eighties. Suddenly a whole 
series of hammock patents are entered each year: 6 in 1881; 8 in 1882; 11 in 
91 U.S. Patent 32,643, 25 June 1861. The earliest American patent covering camp furniture. Seven 
patents for camp furniture were granted in that -year. 
92 
U.S. Patent 33.362, 24 Sept. 1861. 
ss Mainly from 1861 to 1864. We have no exact survey, for camp furniture often lurks among the in­
numerable other headings of the patent records.
