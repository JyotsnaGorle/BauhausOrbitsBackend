new artistic impulse. It required a stimulus that does not derive from the soil 
alone. The man who brought to life an age-old, primitive tradition ,in Finland 
was the architect Alvar Aalto. He never lived outside Finland for long. After 
his first appearance at the International Congress for Modern Architecture, in 
1929, nearly every year saw him in some part of Europe and later in America. 
He needed to settle nowhere, for his tentacles were feeling everywhere. He 
knows what is being huilt and painted. Like the scnlptor, Calder, but in the 
field of architecture and furniture, Aalto mastered the expression of our time and 
fused it with the things of his native surroundings. This alliance of the regional 
with the language born of a period has been fruitfnl in every age.
