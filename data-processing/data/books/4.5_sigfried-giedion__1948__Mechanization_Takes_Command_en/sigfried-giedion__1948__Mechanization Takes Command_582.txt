within a perforated metal basket. The vertical type with agitator became the 
usual nonautomatic home washer. It originated in the "sixties'" (fig. 377). 
The final operation is the centrifugal drying of the clothes. Here one of the 
greA>test difficulties arose. Washing has to he performed hy slow rotary or 
oscillatory movements, while the drying or expelling of water requires high­
speed spinning. Thus speed-change and timing mechanisms are prerequisites 
of the automatic washer. 
The automatic washer, whether on a horizontal or a vertiml axis, typimlly 
consists of a single receptacle or tuh, inside which there rotates a perforated 
basket. The single-tuh and drier type, which expells the water from the basket 
100 
hy centrifugal force, also goes back to the wave of invention of the late 'sixties.
The 'seventies disclosed the broad idea of extracting an amount of the wash­
ing and rinsing liquid from the basket hy centrifugal force and recirculating hy 
101 
pump from the tuh hack to the hasket. A patent was filed in 1878 for a power­
driven, single-tuh washer and dryer having two speeds, low for washing, high 
102 
for drying. The speed change was of course accomplished hy hand. 
The idea of full automatic laundering was pursued time and again down to 
the period of full mechanization. The early 'twenties saw the manufacture of 
various single-tuh washing and drying machines, where slow-speed washing 
and high-speed spinning were used for successive washings and rinsings. After 
1900 the problem of the self-operating washer became largely narrowed down to 
finding the means of automatic control. A clock or electric-motor timer sets off 
electro-magnets or operates a hydraulic mechanism to open and close the valves, 
103 
connect and disconnect the power from the cylinder.
A further problem hindered the rapid solution of the washing automaton: 
the mechanical speed change from washing to drying action. This was not 
difficult to deal with as soon as the means came to hand, the two-speed electric

U.S. Patent 94,005, 24 Aug. 1869. The vertical type was pioneered by machines such as the Laun­
dryette (1917), whose production was discontinued in 1923. In the whole period down to 1939 no single­
tub washer and drier type was on the market. The principal patents for the automatic vertical type 
are those of James B. Kelly, designer of the Laundryette, filed between 1924 and 1928. They form the 
basis for licenses for the vertical cylinder type. 
too Our remarks on the automatic washer are based on a patent investigation made in Dec. 1944 by 
the patent department of the Apex Electrical Manufacturing Co,, Cleveland, Ohio, 'On the History of 
the Automatic Washing !\lachine Prior to Wales Patent' (typewritten), and on personal letters from 
Mr. Frantz, President of Apex. \Ve are glad to he able for once to refer to comprehensive research made 
by the industry itself; indeed we are not aware of any writings on the subject other than current adver­
tisements and magazine articles.

102 Centrifugal Machine, U.S. Patent 215,4.28, 20 May 1879. In 1883 application was made for a 
patent (U.S. Patent 420,742, issued 2 Feb. 1890) which outlined the principle of a modern automatic 
washer (Bendix), in so far as it provided a two~spel:',.d, horizontal cylinder.
