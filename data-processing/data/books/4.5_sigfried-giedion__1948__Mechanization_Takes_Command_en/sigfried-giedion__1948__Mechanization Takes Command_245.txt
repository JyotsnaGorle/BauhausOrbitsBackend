Long before production reached its record proportions, the apparatus for mass 
processing was built up, The time of greatest inventive activity can quite easily 
be determined, A few patents for the mechanizing of various operations appeared 
after 1860, From the mid 'sixties through the 'seventies, they were constantly 
o:n the increase, continuing undiminished until after 1880, The basic mechaniz­
ing principles developed during that period remain unchanged even later, No 
less than six patents were granted for hog traps in 1872-3, and no fewer than 
twenty-four patents for various machines in 1874, But from 1877 on, we note 
a marked decrease, the majority of inventions having been developed between 
1867 and 1877, Hog-scraping machines to clean the scalded carcass of its hairs 
and bristles are the exception, Most of tbese were devised in the early 'eighties, 
In 1881 four separate patents were granted for this class of machine, which has 
an important part to play in mechanized hog processing, 
To varying degrees, spinning and weaving, baking and milling had been satis­
factorily mecbanize,d, Would it not be possible to mechanize meat production 
too? 
Enterprising and inventive people tried their hand at this problem, Efforts 
were made to develop machine3 for almost every one of the time-consuming 
Qperations, Yet, as we indicated in discussing the development of the assembly 
line, a complex organic substance with its contingencies, its changing, easily 
vulnerabl0 structure, is something other than a piece of amorphous iron, This 
was true also of the dead animaL Despite many attempts, processing of its 
carcass could not be fully mechanized, 
This frrst clash between mechanization and complex organic substance is far 
more interesting from the historic'!ll point of view than from the technologicaL 
How are the unpredictable contingencies that nature produces to be overcome 
by mechanical devices? Such is the root of the problem, To anticipate the 
answer: The engineer did not emerge victorious in this contest. 
It may be worth while to glance at this largely unexplored territory even if 
the patents occasionally concern somewhat devious proposals (figs, 116, 122) 
and in their early stages resemble medieval instruntents of torture rather than 
highly developed machines, 
CATCHING AND SUSPENDING THE LIVE HOG 
No single invention for the mechanization of slaughtering drew so many 
efforts as the one that sought to incorporate the living hog into the production 
line, Here at the beginning of the operations it was most important to avoid 
bottlenecks that might bold up the entire factory,
