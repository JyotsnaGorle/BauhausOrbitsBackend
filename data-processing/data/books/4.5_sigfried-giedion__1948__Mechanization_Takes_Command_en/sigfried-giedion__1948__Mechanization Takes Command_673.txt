In Germany his views on gymnastics were regarded as unmanly. But the 
North, especially Sweden and Demnark, went firmly through with the more 
humanitarian eighteenth-century conception of gymnastics as the cultivation 
of litheness. 
As Pestalozzi made puhlic his proposals for an 'Elementary Gymnastics' 
(1807), Ludwig Jahn, the apostle of 'German Turnkunst,' was already giving 
gymnastics another meaning and direction. He too aimed to harden the body, 
hut his were exercises of discipline. 'Military exercises, even without guns, 
huild a manly character, awaken and stimulate the sense of order, and inculcate 
obedience to leadership." Jahn therefore introduced military commands, drill­
ing in squads, gray twill uniforms, at the first Turnplatz in the Berlin Hasenheide 
(1811). The equipment that Jahn and others used has remained ahnost 
unchanged to this day. Hardening and swinnning also played a part. But all 
in all, specialized preparation for national and militaristic ends held the fore­
ground. The nineteenth century was beginning.

Even in 1850 criticism is made of Pestalozzi's methods that be would he better advised to take model 
upon the wrestlers of Emmenthal, and by 1817 Ludwig Jahn, founder of German Tu.rnkunst was ener­
getically attacking 'free exercises': 'Every exercise must have an object. Let us take fencing as an 
example: cutting and lunging at the air can amonnt to nothing more than mirror-play.' (Quoted in Carl
