399. Electric Ironing, 1911. Electricity has made 
continoous ironing possible. In the early day,q of 
domestic current, the iron was plugged io the chan­
deliers, like the gas iron of the 'fifties. The side-by-side 
use of gwdighl and electric light, and the rigging of the 
cord suggesllhe improvised use of the wlwle appliance.

day- the hardship to which he was submitting his wife: 'You think it is hot, 
109 
do you? Put a stove in your office' (fig. 398).
The next step is the attack on the small iron itself. In 1922, Christine Fred­
erick turns to the American housewife: 'You may say you do not use the old 
type of flat iron, that you use an electric iron; that indeed is one step in advance. 
Even that is inefficient.' And she who, ten years earlier had begun her New 
Housekeeping Series with a reckoning of wasted motions in dish washing, argues 
once again: 'Now isn't it foolish to iron a tablecloth, an are,a of about 18,000 
square inches, with a heated tool measuring only 24 inches?' no The new house­
hold tool was the ironer. In this instrument the ironing hoard has become a 
padded roll and the iron has taken on the aspect of a curved and gleaming 
brake-shoe extending the whole width of the cylinder and electrically heated 
(fig. 402). One may easily remove it from contact with the roller or cause it to 
press the roller's surface. The thickly padded cylinder, in the later models at 
least, has 'two roll-speeds, slow for heavy, faster for light articles.' The heating 
elements within the shoe are controlled by thermostats. As so often in mecha­
nization, the to-and~fro motion of the hand has been transformed into continuous 
rotation. The whole instrument in the form now qnite widespread in the Ameri­
can household is a product of electrification. It first appears in mail-order 
lOll In an advertising pamphlet, You and Your Laundry, Chicago, 1922.
