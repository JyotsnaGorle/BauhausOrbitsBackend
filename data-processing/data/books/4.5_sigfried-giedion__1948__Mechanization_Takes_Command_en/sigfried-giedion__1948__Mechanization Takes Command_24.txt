reading their line of fate, over wide spans of time. Vertical sections make it 
possible to trace the organic changes of a type. 
How far a type need he followed hack into its history varies with the case. 
There are no rules or recipes. It is not the historian who guides, hut the material. 
Some of the developments will call for far-reaching retrospect, others only for 
rapid backward glances. What is essential is the panoramic and simultaneous 
view. This may lead to discontinuous treatment. For only through simultane­
ous perception of various periods and of various fields within a period can there 
he insight into the inner growth. 
Conceiving of history as constellations, the historian can claim one more 
freedom. He assumes the right to observe at close range certain phenomena, 
certain fragments of meaning, while omitting others from his field of attention. 
This may lead to unwonted proportions, as in contemporary painting when a 
hand is made to spread over the picture while the body remains a hint or a 
fragment. This freedom in handling proportion is no less necessary when one 
seeks to represent the meaning of historical complexes. 
Dates 
The historian's objectivity may he voiced in a treatment faithful to the nature 
of the material as well as to its constellations in time. 
Dates are the historian's yardstick. They enable him to measure off historical 
space. In themselves or when pinned to isolated facts, they are as meaningless 
as the numbers on a ticket. But conceived in interrelation, that is vertically 
and horizontally connected within the network of historical objects, they delimit 
constellations. In such cases dates take on meaning. 
Dates marking when and where phenomena first appear or have become com­
monplace in various spheres form complexes that give objective insight into 
growth.
