may read a great many books without moving from one place.' (fig. 156). 
This is a true wheel. On its tilted planes, like those of a water wheel, the hooks 
were so placed that any desired volume might be carried to eye level. Around 
1730 Jac<Jb Schuebler designed an ambitious piec,e, a combination counting足
34 
table for merchants, to house acmunt books and the correspondence of a 
whole year besides, The single files were arranged around a wheel within the 
desk (fig. 155). Schuebler's idea of a rotating file for rapid reference reappears 
today in a wheel of steel tnbes 'honsing np to 15,000 reference cards within the 
35 
convenient reach of the operator (fig. 157) while saving 40% operator personnel.' 
And the production-planning department of an aviation plant has hnilt, on an 
experimental hasis, octagonal 'doughnut desks,' where the clerk sits in the central 
opening. The files radiate horizontally from the center. 'It has jumped clerical 
36 
efficiency 850%.' 
The demand for adjustable and combinable fnrnitnre also makes itself felt 
in the late Gothic household. The swing-back bench bas a movable back rest. 
It stood before the hearth, as in the Werl altar by the Master of Flemalle (1438) 
(fig. 153), and allowed the sitter either to face the fire or warm his back, at will.
