patent (1931) (fig. 497) would deliver the sections of the bathroom in panel 
form to he assembled by 'a mason, a carpenter, and a plasterer,' the plumber 
being almost altogether done away with. The hath unit in horizontal sections 
is also deliverable 'in packaged fom1.' Its 'non-separable,' rounded corners 
112 
were claimed as an especial advantage (fig. 499). 
Other early proposals (1931) make the hath cell a structural unit installable 
'in sealed condition,' no workman having to set foot in it while the house is 
under construction. All the connections are on the outside, ready to he screwed 
through extensible joints to the units above and below. A crane swings the unit 
113 
bodily from the truck to the exact spot in the building where it is needed 
(fig. 498). lt was mainly intended for the skeleton construction of apartment 
houses or hotels. Raymond Hood, inspirer of Rockefeller Center, planned 
(1932) to incorporate the plumbing and fJXtures of an apartment house (unfor足
tunately never executed) within a mechanical core.

ln type, R. Buckminster Fuller's 'prefabri.cated bathroom' (1938) (fig. 500) 
is a structural unit. His sectioning of the shell into two parts for easier indoor 
and outdoor transport is of minor importance. The solution is original, com足
prehensive, extreme. A model made of copper sheeting was shown in prominent 
places and aroused lively discussion. 
Its every component, from the soap holder to the tub, forms arr integral part 
of the wall or floor. The washbasin and toilet are placed opposite one another, 
with the somewhat raised bathtub behind them- a 4'6" X 5' layout such as 
is normal only in cramped circumstances. All the components are pressed simul足
taneously with the metal skin, their hollows sometimes helping to give the 
system additional rigidity. The exhaustive patent specification, a model of 
precision, is evidence of the care with which every square inch was worked out, 
so that the dies would have the highest industrial efficiency, and the bathrooms 
could he stamped out by the million at minimal cost. Why not seize this oppor足
tunity? 
As so often in the eagerness of full mechanization, the construction ran away 
with the constructor and the human problem became lost in the stamping. From 
clean, hygienic enamel, the material is changed to thin metal sheeting, so that 
the machine may complete its work at one blow. In tem1s of comfort, this means 
m U.S. Patent, 1,978,842, 30 Oct. 1934. The patent specification thoroughly describes the patchwork 
of hand~installed plumbing. 
nt Applied for in 1934. U.S. Patent, 2,087,121, 13 July 1937. This 'consolidated room unit' as it is 
called in the specification directly combines the pi'pe-elements and the walls- which suggests a difficult 
task of replacement should freezing cause a pipe to burst.
