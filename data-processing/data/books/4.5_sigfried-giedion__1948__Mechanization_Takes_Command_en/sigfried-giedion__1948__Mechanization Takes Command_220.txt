Graham was relatively alone in his time. The questions he raised have hecn 
raised again, and on a broader plane, in Europe. There, in the very countries 
that enjoy high living standards, a reaction has set in, not against patent flour

appearing in ever-new fields, and should in the long run outlive the dictatorship 
of production.
