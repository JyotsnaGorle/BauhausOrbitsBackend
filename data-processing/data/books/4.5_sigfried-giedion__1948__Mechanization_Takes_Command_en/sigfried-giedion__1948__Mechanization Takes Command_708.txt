lhe American Bath Cell c. 19l5 
THE ll'\FLl!ENCE OF THE HOTEL 
487. Mount Vernon Hot.el, Cape May, New Jersey, 1853. A bath with rnnning water was installed £n 
er,ery bedroom, accordi-l~g to the Illnslrated London News {18;);~). 'Each room is cvmp/cte in itself and con~ 
tains all the conven.i'encesf& the comfort of the inhabitant.' This was half a cenfnry before the bathroom became 
an appendage of each lwlel room. 
America piloted the development from the moment the hath became democra­
tized; that is, from the middle of the second decade and in the time of full mechan­
ization. Standard layouts now make their first appearance, for a clear stand 
has been taken: the bath shall be an appendage to the bedroom. This was not 
a matter of chance. 
The American type had its origins outside the home: in the hotel. The hotel, 
it has been recognized, 'gave the Americans an opportunity to serape their 
first acquaintance with the bath tubs, cold and hot running water, water closet 
and steam . . . Among the many things that entered American life through 
the hotels, of all the many ways in which Amerimn domestic life has been 
92 
influenced by hotels, the influence of the hotel bathroom stands preeminent.'
