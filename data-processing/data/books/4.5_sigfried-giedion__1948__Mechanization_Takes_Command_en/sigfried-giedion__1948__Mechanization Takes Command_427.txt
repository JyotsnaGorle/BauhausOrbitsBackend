The American barber chair, like the American railway seat, differs fundamentally from its European 
counterpart. The one is rigid, the other mobile. The problem was to make the seat and back mobile and 
capable of being fixed in variable positions.

The harher's problem is simple. The customer should either sit upright or 
lie ahuost horizontally. Hair-cutting cannot do with foreshortened perspective; 
there is but one correct position, the vertical, which requires a normal seat. For 
shaving, the customer is in the most favorable position when swung so far into 
the horizontal that both cheeks and the underside of the chin present almost 
vertical surfaces. Then the harher may work most efficiently. Moreover, the 
customer lies in a helpless position, which discourages unforeseen movements. 
This posture calls for surface on which to lie at full length. Readily to combine 
the two activities, shaving and hair-cutting, the chair should be movable and 
adjustable. This careful breakdown of the functions to he fulillled by the barber's

and the power of locking in any desired position. In 1850 no better way of
