122. Skinning Cattle hy Power. 1867. Still impossible today, mechanized skmning was allempled at an 
early dale. But the skin of animals is Wo delicate to handle otherwise than by knife and hand. l'his drawing, 
with its naive means seeking to illustrate a mechanical device, forms an original piece of American folk art. 
(U.S. Patent 63,910, 16 April J867) 
better adaptation to the animal shape. It is on this second attempt that the 
modern machines are based, which hourly scrape over 750 carcasses moving on 
the assembly line. 
Toward the end of the 'seventies, and with all the refinement afforded by this 
time of rapidly improving techniques, even further approximation was made to 
the form of the animal. 'The machine should be entirely self-adjusting to the 
varying sizes of the carcasses passing through and also to the varying outlines. 
. . . My invention consists therefore in a series of cylinders, each armed with 
sets of elastic scrapers and distributed at different points. . . . Each of these 
... being independently movable and free to advance and recede to 
cylinders

follow the contours of the carc.ass.' 
With expanding production in the early 'eighties and a yearly turnover in 
Chicago of some five million hogs, the demand for efficient machines of this sort 
68 
became ever more urgent. At a time when improvements of other machines 
in the meat-packing field were falling off, the number of hog-stTaping patents 
69 
was rising.

Patent 184,390, 6 Sept. 1876. Another time the 'profile of the scrapers' is made 'curvilinear' to permit 
more effective action. U.S. Patent 196,269, 29 Mar. 1377.
