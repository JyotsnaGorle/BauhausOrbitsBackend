historical painter, Alfred Hethel (1816-59), about the mid-nineteenth century 
(fig. 126). He calls 1he series' Another Danse Macabre' (1849). \\ith oinisttr 
skill and in the nohle woodcut tradition of Albrecht Durer, death is abused for 
purposes of political propaganda. These woodcuts do not deal with the phenom­
enon of death. The)' represent a political satire against the revolution of 1848: 
Death masquerades as a dmnagogue. Moralizing stanzas warn against the slogans 
of republic, of liberty and fraternity. 
He lifts his coat., and as they look, 
Their hearts are terror-stricken. 
Death has been degraded into a mere costume. An earlier cut, 'Death as a 
Strangler' (1847), pictures DeA!th as fiddling on bones. The choice of the scene 
is significant. It uses Heinrich Heine's description of the outbreak of the cholera 
epidemic in 1831 at a Paris masquerade. 
In the fifteenth century, the Last Judgment, inseparable from death, was a 
reality as threatening and perhaps more dreaded than death itself. In the nine­
teenth, only death in its biological nakedness remains, and even this is kept 
doseted. Hence all images of 1hat time dealing with our relation to death,
