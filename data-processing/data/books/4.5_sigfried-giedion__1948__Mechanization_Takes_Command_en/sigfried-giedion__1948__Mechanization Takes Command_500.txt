These Rietveldian pieces are manifestoes. They guide the direction of an entire 
development. No assembly line, no routineer can supply the fantasy they em足
body. As furniture is broken down to make a fresh start possible, its elements 
resolve into a system of struts and planes. Its form is as neutral as possible.
