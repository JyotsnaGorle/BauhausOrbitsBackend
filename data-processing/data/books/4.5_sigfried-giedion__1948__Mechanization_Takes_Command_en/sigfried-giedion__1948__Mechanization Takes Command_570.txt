385. First American Electric ·Motor, 1837. Powered .from a copper and zinc plate ballery. The patent i..'( 
entitled' Application of iliagnelism and ElectrO-./Hagnelism to Propelling Afach.in.ery.' Faraday invented his 
motor Rhorlly after discovertng inducted currents (Hl31). Several efectri.c motors were designed in England 
during the following year. (U.S. Patent 132, 25 February 1837) 
The electric motor likewise went through a long incubation period. To trace 
its hopeful beginnings, its fumblings and false starts, more numerous than for 
any other mover, would lead us away from our topic. We shall merely give a 
few co-ordinates by which to locate it in time. The first electric motor was built 
by Michael Faraday after his discovery of inducted currents (1831). It con­
sisted of a copper disk rotating between the poles of a powerful magnet. The 
galvanic current arising in the disk could easily be canalized. But Faraday was

A.C. motor was probably the first of the commercially produced small power units that later punctuated the
