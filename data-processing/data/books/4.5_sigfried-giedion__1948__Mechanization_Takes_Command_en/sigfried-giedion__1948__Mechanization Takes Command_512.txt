The whole interior laid down the new standard. Instead of 'designed' vases 
of glass or ceramics, there were laboratory jars, forms purified hy use and func­
tion. Instead of elaborate cut-crystal, there were the simple wine glasses of 
any French cafe, ohjeets whose form never ceased to refresh the fantasy of the 
Cubist painters. Instead of the carpets of interior decoration were the vigorously 
woven Berber carpets from North Africa, with their simple abstract patterns. 
Instead of tear-drop chandeliers were stage floodlights or store-window illumina­
tion. Instead of the knickknacks of arts and crafts were the mother of pearl 
spirals of a sea-shell; and on the balustrade of the upper floor, a free-standing 
sculpture by Jacques Lipchitz. 
In the same spirit and as a final touch, the colored walls were hung with paint­
ings by Juan Gris, Fernand Leger, Picasso, Ozenfant, and LeCorhusier. Through­
out was the search for a pure, more ciirect form wherever it might be found: 
in nature, in laboratories, in Bedouin carpets, in industria·) manufacture purified 
by serial production. This union of seemingly unrelated elements did away with 
the idea that all the objects of an interior should be designed by one hand. A 
room is not an incubator to be sterilized of all foreign germs. The forms of life, 
past and present, shall be given an opportunity to interact. 
The atmosphere that can arise from the free interplay of heterogeneous ele­
ments is familiar to all those who have set foot in later interiors of our period. 
It was at the Pavilion de !'Esprit Nouveau, in 1925, that one first saw this so 
clearly and consistently expressed.
