that. We shall see later how phenomena often regarded solely as the outcome 
of mechanization bad already appeared before mechanization took effect. The 
relation to the soil hegan to alter when, early in the nineteenth century, before 
mechanized agriculture bad come into heing, the settlers abandoned the old 
Atlantic States and migrated westwards. 
Then the tiller of the soil entered into flux. Mechanization did no more than 
magnify a latent trend into the gigantic. Does the changing farmer reflect, hut 
more conspicuously, a process that is everywhere aL work? Can wha L is Laking 
place in tbe farmer be a projection of something that is going on throughout? 
Does the transformation into wandering unemployed of people who for centuries 
had tilled the soil correspond to what is happening in each of us? In tJus process, 
has movement, the basic concept of our world-image, been transposed, in dis­
torted form, into human destiny? During and after the Second World War the 
violent uprooting of millions has hccome a coolly accepted practice. 
Other periods too have had their mass displacements, whether hy free will, 
violence, or force of circumstance. Yet in due time the people came to rest. 
Is what we are witnessing today lhe convulsions of a transition period, different 
from earlier periods, yet penetrated like them with the need for continuity? 
Or does it represent a remolding of life into ways for which a form is as yet lack­
ing, and of which the structural alteration of farming, man's basic calling, stands 
as the first symptom? 
These are questions that as yet cannot he unequivocally answered. They 
transcend differences of economic system, and are bound up with the great 
human constants. These constants change as little as our organism does, within 
narrow 1imits. Down to the present no fruit, no work, no culture has grown 
otherwise than through intentness and concentration.
