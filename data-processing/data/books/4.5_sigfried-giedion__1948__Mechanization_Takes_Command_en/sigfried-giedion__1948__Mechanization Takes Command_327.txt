174. The Marquise (Easy Chairfor Two). 'Le Mari mnfesseur,' Engraving by N. F. 
Regnault after Fragonard. 1795. This consciol1$ly archaic print after Fragonard's 
illu,slration to a fable by fA Fontaine is treated in {he playfulLy anecdotie and superftcial 
manner lhat forms a starling point for the ruling taste in nineteenth-century painting. 
alone, the cavaliers around her, as the husband arrives unexpectedly on the

scene (fig. 174). 
He who would know the spirit of the Rococo must not trust too far the late 
engravings of the 'seventies, and even less the erotic subjects of later date, The 
erotic scenes are backward-looking witnesses, artificially prolonging a bygone 
period. In the late lifetime of Fragonard, this atmosphere degenerates into one 
of superficial playfulness. This lapse into genre treatment forms one of the start­
ing points of nineteenth-century ruling taste: Rococo for bourgeois consumption. 
The meaning of the Rococo appears - as is so ?ften the case- in painting, 
at a time when neither Rococo furniture nor Rococo interior yet existed. Early 
in the eighteenth century, Watteau (1684-1721) anticipates the fusion of organic 
form with spiritual alertness that was later to become a reality.
