Around 1900 the band-cranked washing machine began to replace the back­
breaking washboard, as a pamphlet of 1924 retrospectively records. 
In 1912 Christine Frederick, who was in close touch with the situation, wrote 
in the Ladies Home Journal, 'Washing is done in most houses without washing 
machines and with only a common boiler.' 
HOME LAUNDERING FULLY MECHANIZED 
'V ashing machines and vacuum cleaners are an index of mechanization in 
household cleaning. Their use expands as their cost is lowered. In 1926, refrig­
had an average retail price of $400, and 200,000 units were sold; by 1935 
erators 
their price had sunk to $170 and sales reached 1.5 million units. The identical 
thing occurs in washing machine sales. From 1926 to 1935 washer demand rose 
from 900,000 units to 1.4 million units, while the average retail price was more

than halved- from $150 to $60. A large mail-order house cut the washer 
price to a record of $29.95 in 1936. This is the time of the democratization of 
comfort. 
Just as full mechanization concentrated the grain production line from reaping 
to bagging in the small baby combine, so in this period home laundering was 
brought to the verge of being fully mechanized. The idea of an automaton, a 
self-operating washer, to perform all the operations from soiled linen to washed 
and damp-dried clothes without interference of the human hand, preoccupied 
numerous inventors. Intricate mechanisms are necessary in order to eliminate 
the hand and attain full automaticity -mechanisms to time each operation, 
introduce the water into the tub, release the washing water, introduce rinsing 
water, cxpell it and re-circulate it hy pump, and finally damp-dry the clothes. 
to be combined within the same receptacle: wash­
Two distinct operations have 
ing and drying. 
The fully mechanized washing automaton follows two basic designs. One is 
the lwrizonlal 'cylinder type' originating in the 1850's, where a perforated inner

cylinder rotates on a horizontal axis (fig. 396).
The second type is on a vertical axis, the clothes being cleansed by an agitator
