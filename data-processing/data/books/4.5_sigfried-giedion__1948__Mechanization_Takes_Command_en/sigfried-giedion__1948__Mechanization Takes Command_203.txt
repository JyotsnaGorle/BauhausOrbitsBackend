that the bleaching process causes no deleterious effects, or they who claim that 
the present milliog methods remove the most important nutritional values from 
the grain. W c need only note that the new methods arose io the demand for 
greater output, the human considerations having little voice in the matter. 
Mechanization of the milling process yielded a brilliant fa~ade and a more or 
less artificial product. The oleaginous germ that formerly made the flour someÂ­
what greasy to the touch, and which contains the most valuable elements, has 
been rigorously excluded. More recently, we have seen attempts to make good 
the values removed from the flour by vitamin reinforcements added to the yeast 
or the dough. The whiteness of the flour remains unspotted. But such measures 
remind one of a dentist who extracts good natural teeth, filling the void with a 
bright and handsome set of artificial ones. The device of adding vitamins is a 
simple one. It consists of a metal cabinet slotted like a letter box. The vitamin 
paste dropping in small clusters into the flour is thoroughly mixed with it by a 
screw conveyor such as Oliver Evans used.
