Hethel's compositions among them, have become untrue. They usc devaluated 
symbols unsupported by the living reality of belief. 
The greater the degree of mechanization, the further does contact with death 
become banished from life. Death is merely viewed as an unavoidable accident 
at the end, as we shall point out in discussing why the medieval conception of 
comfort so differeA:! from that of later periods. It is more honest to picture death 
in its crassness as the Spaniard, Louis llunuel, in his motion picture Le Chien 
Andalon (1929), did symbolically (figs. 128, 129). There the symbolization of 
death is found in the play of irrational associations. Trivial everyday happenings 
and phantastic occurrences are interwoven inlo an artistic reality: A razor 
becomes a long-stretched cloud cutting through the full moon in the night sky, 
and turns into a murderer's knife slicing through a young woman's eye. The 
scenariO runs: 
A balcony in the night. 
Near the balcony a man is sharpening his razor. Tiw man looks at the sky through the 
window panes and sees ... 
A slight cloud moving towards the moon, which is full. 
Then the head of a young woman open-eyed. 
The slight cloud now passes before the moon. 
The blade of the razor is drawn through the eye of the young woman, sla'lhing it.n
