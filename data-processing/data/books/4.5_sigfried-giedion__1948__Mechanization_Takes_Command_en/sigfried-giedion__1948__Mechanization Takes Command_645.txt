Regeneration in Antiquity 
The Greek bath is indivisible from the institution that gave it meaning. It 
cannot be divorced from the gymnasium, the educational center of the Hel­
lenes.' The Greek bath was most simply performed. It consisted mainly of 
cold showers and ablutions. The marble trough with ruuning water, and the 
simple hollows for foot baths -as found in the Hellenistic gymnasium of Priene 
-reveal how simple was the process, and how it was woven into a wider pur­
pose. The hath forms but one link within the gynmasium; its place is between 
strenuous gynmastic sport or pentathlon in the palestra, and philosophical 
discussion in the semi-circular exedra. It lies on the divide between the hours 
of strong physical effort and of contemplative discourse. No other period more 
organically fused the bath into human regeneration (fig. 445a). 
The Roman thermae are technified gymnasia. They comprise ahnost the 
same elements as the Greek institutions; the stress, however, has shifted, and 
they grow to enormous dimensions. This occurs in the first century B.c. Herod­
otus' often-quoted remark ' that the Greeks of his time, the fifth century B.C., 
generated steam by red-hot irons or heated stones, as the Middle Ages were 
to do later, points at best to a beginning. But how the development proceeded 
from the fifth century to the first century B.c. on Greek soil, in Asia Minor, 
or in Egypt, is still veiled in uucertainty.

Tub baths were used in private houses at the time of the gymnasia. But the private bath was of 
minor importance in Greece.
