Frank B. Gilbreth (1868-1921) was the first to capture with full precision the 
complicated trajectory of human movcmenl. 
We do not wish to strain the comparison. Nicolas Oresme marks at a decisive 
point the schism between the ancient and modern world. A task so easy in 
appearance as the representation of movement demands a faculty of thought 
and abstraction hard for us to grasp today. The American production engineer, 
Frank B. Gilbreth, is but one link in the great process of mechanization. But 
in our connection we do not hesitate to point out a bridge between Nicolas 
Oresme and Gilbreth. Oresme realized the nature of movement and represented 
it by graphic methods. Gilbreth, about five and a half centuries later, detached 
human movement. from its bearer or subject, and achieved its precise visualiza­
tion in space and time (fig. 19). Gilbreth is an innovator in the field of scientific 
management. His thinking and his methods grow out of the great body of 
nineteenth-century science. 
A new realm opens: new forms, new expressive values, transcending the 
domain of the engineer.
