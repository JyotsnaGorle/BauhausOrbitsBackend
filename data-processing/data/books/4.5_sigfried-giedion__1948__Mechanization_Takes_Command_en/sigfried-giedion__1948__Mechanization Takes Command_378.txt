As France had set the fashion under the First Empire, so it did under the 
Second, There many of the transitory furniture types of the epoch were first 
seen, But the structure of society had changed much since the day of Napoleon 1, 
His successor to the imperial throne achieved no style appropriate to his way of 
life, The new types, like the whole interior, answered to the taste of an anony足
mous rising class, the self-made man, of which Napoleon I was an early repre足
sentative, The work of the upholsterer and the taste of the rising class seemed 
to be marked out for one another, 
This class, owing its wealth mainly to the mechanized means of production, 
grew up wherever industrialization succeeded. It 'vas international: in France, 
in England during the Victorian era, in America at the time of the railroad boom 
of the early 'seventies, and finally in Germany, which suddenly entered upon 
a hitherto unknown prosperity, Germany's late, almost hectic industrialization 
after 1870 went hand in band with the extreme development of the ruling taste, 
Nothing seemed able to withstand the devaluation of symbols, 57 
Counter-Current-<s: The Engineer and the Reformer 
As so often in the nineteenth ce.ntury, the most contradictory tendencies 
arise simultaneously and side by side, In America during the 'fifties and 'sixties 
inventive fantasy and the instinct for mechanization were the common property 
the people, There, the furniture of the engineer was created in glorious uncon足
of 
cern, It is the absolute opposite of the ruling taste, We shall pay considerable 
attention to this furniture of the engineer, which developed parallel in time 
with the furniture of the upholsterer, for despite its mechanization it was created 
without reflection, like product.' of popular art, The anonymous inventors 
were concerned only with the solution of specific problems, 
In England the situation was quite different, Henry Cole and the reformers 
of 1850 directed their struggle against the false mechanization of adornment, 
The next generation, led by William Morris and John Husk in, stressed the level足
side of mechanization, and condemned the machine on 
ing and dehumanizing 
principle, The basic aim of the Morris cirde, which made itself heard around 
1860, proved impossible of fulfilment: a revival of handicraft together with a 
return to the late Gothic, At first the circle produced dressers, beloved of the

tion of examples: Das Deutsche Zimmer, Anreyunyen zu haii.~licher Kunstpjlege, ~. stark venn. aufl., Miin~ 
chen, 1886. Here Hirth, founder of the periodical Jugend (whenee the 'Juf!;endstil' or Arl Nonveau drew 
its name), reproduced still lives of helmets, daggers, and vasP$ that an upholsterer or decorator bad 
designed for an uppeNniddle-class dwelling.
