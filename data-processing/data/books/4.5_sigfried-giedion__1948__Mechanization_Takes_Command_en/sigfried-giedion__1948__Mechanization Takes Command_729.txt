MAN IN EQUIPOISE 
We have tried to assemble fragments of the anonymous history of our period. 
The searchlight has fallen on scattered facts and facets, leaving vast stretches of 
darkness he tween. The complexes of meaning thus arising have not been explic足
itly linked. In the mind of the active reader new interrelations and new com足
plexes of meaning will be found. This does not relieve us from answering the 
question: Does our present day accept mechanization? 
The problem is so intricately related to social, economic, and emotional realities 
that mere affirmation or mere negation leads nowhere. Everything depends on 
how, and for what purposes, mechanization is used. 
What does mechanization mean to man? 
Mechanization is an agent, like water, fire, light. It is blind and without direc足
tion of its own. It must be canalized. Like the powers of nature, mechanization 
depends on man's capacity to make use of it and to protect himself against its 
inherent perils. Because mechanization sprang entirely from the mind of man, 
it is the more dangerous to him. Being less easily controlled than natural forces, 
mechanization reacts on the senses and on the mind of its creator. 
To control mechanization demands an unprecedented superiority over the 
instruments of production. It requires that everything be subordinated to human 
needs. 
From the very first it was clear that mechanization involved a division of labor. 
The worker cannot manufacture a product from start to finish; from the stand足
point of the consumer the product becomes increasingly difficult to master. 
When the motor of his car fails, the owner often does not know which part is 
causing the tronhle; an elevator strike can paralyze the whole life of New York. 
As a result, the individual becomes increasingly dependent on production and on 
society as a whole, and relations are far more complex and interlocked than in 
any earlier society. This is one reason why today man is overpowered by means.
