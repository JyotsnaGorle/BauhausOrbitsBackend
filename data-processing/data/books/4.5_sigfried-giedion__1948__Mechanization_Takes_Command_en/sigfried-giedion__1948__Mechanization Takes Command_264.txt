132. Arti:lkial i\1otber in the Time of Full J\.1echanil:ation: Eleetrieal Brooder, 1940. Between 1918 and 
1944 artificially hatched eggs in lhe United Stales increased from twenty per cent to eighly~fire per cent of the 
total. The electricalfy heated incubalor unit contains about 52,000 eggs. (Hawkins J\Hilion Dollar Hen, 
Mount Vernon, Illinois) 
The tremendous increase in artificial hatching comes with the time of full 
mechanization. From 1918 to 1944, artificially hatched eggs increase from 20 per 
cent to 85 per cent of the total. One reason given for this is that after 1918 
~10ung chicks could be sent through the mails. Actually, the rise is in keeping 
with the general trend. Mass production and rearing chicks from selected eggs 
are more profitable. One danger is the dissemination of disease; careful control 
that of unscrupulous dealers. 
is necessary. Another is 
To keep production as regular as possible, artificial light is used in the laying 
houses on autumn and winter mornings, to stimulate the ovaries. Although 
this does not increase the total production, it equalizes it so far as possible 
throughout the year, and makes possible poultry processing in mechanized 
plants --introduced toward the 'thirties. The delicacy the Grand Duke of 
Tuscany was at pains to provide for his court is now available to all. 
Before the advent of mass production in poultry raising, chicken used to 
cost about twice as much in winter as in summer. Now freshly killed poultry 
is available the year round. A mechanism is being sought that will mechanically 
separate the bones from the meat. 
Mechanical Fertilization 
How organic life is generated was of especial concern to the century that 
questioned everything to find an answer in everything. Skepticism and univerÂ­
sality go baud in hand in the eighteenth century. Just as the period probes 
the life of plants and animals, of insects and mammals, so it seeks to explore 
microe.copic life.
