It is a noteworthy advance that makes possible the impregnation of 45,000 
sheep hy 8 rams. Yet the question remains whether nature is not in a sense 
ever bound to waste. Introducing the artificial insemination of mares to the 
Middle West in the 'nineties, tl1e advocator himself raised the question whether 
15 
the mare 'should not be "in love," as it were, with the horse.' One thing is 
certain. Mechanization comes to a halt before living substance. A new out­
look must prevail if nature is to be mastered rather than degraded. The utmost 
caution is imperative. This calls for an attitude turning radically away from 
the idolatry of production.

'The scientists may t.alk loud and long ahout the germ~plasms being unchangeable, hut the writer's 
experience teaches him that when the contracting animals are in mental union the resulting foal is sure to 
be docile.' -'On Breeding Mares,' The Horseman, Chicago, vol. XIV, 8 March 1894. Regarding the intro­
duction of artificial insemination the same writer point" out: 'When I first hegan to talk of it I was made 
fun of by almm;t everyone (that was in 1893) but today it is talked of almost, as a necessity in mtmy 
instances in my neighbourhood.' (The Horseman, 30 May 1395.)
