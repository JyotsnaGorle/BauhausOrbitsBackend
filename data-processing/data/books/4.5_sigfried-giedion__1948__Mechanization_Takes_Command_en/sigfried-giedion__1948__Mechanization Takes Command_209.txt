Tlw Changed Nature of Mechanized Bread 
The question still remains: How was bread changed under the influence of 
mechanization? 
Dr. Dauglish's carbonated bread had an extremely uniform, finely porous 
structure, produced hy the stream of gas injected under pressure. The crust 
was relatively hard, but the inside was elastic as a rubber sponge and completely 
tasteless. It did little good to mix the dough with wine instead of with water, 
as was later done in the hope that the acid ingredients would heighten its flavor. 
Dr. Dauglish's actual formula did not prevail, hut characteristics distinguish­
ing his mechanical bread from that of the pre-industrial period have.

How did it become possible, after 1900, for the large baking corporations to 
eliminate the small bakers who had hitherto possessed the market? The experts 
always offer this explanation: the product of the small bakers, they say, was 
always changing; one day it was such, another day it was such. Mechanization, 
on the other hand, furnished bread that was entirely uniform. That the public 
demanded uniformity may he true, hut economic factors were doubtless more 
'd.lllllsive. After 1900 we enter the period when anonymous corporations pene­
trate nearly every province of living. 
Bread as completely homogeneous as Dr. Dauglish obtained hy his gas process 
remained impossible with yeast, that is, fermentation, until the high-speed 
mixer was generally introduced (1928). The tremendous beating power of its
