ture of his time, a hmrty mter, lusty in all appetites. Hogarth did not mince 
matters. He showed great inventiveness in his engravings when it came to 
portraying tares and vices, animals being refinedly tortured, or women spitting 
gin into one another's eyes. The portrait is but a few steps removed from the 
sadistic. 
Not many derndes later, the favored male type is slender, immature, ephem­
eral, and his feminine counterpart is the mild, dreamy maiden, innocent of 
passion. The late eighteenth century, at first in literature, then in painting, 
brings the forerunners of those sentimental types" that were to hold the public 
taste throughout the following century. 
Just as England had first assimilated Flemish painting before developing it 
further, so it adapted the industrial methods that the Huguenot refugees of 
the seventeenth century brought with them from Holland. An immense entre­
preneurial energy develops, leading to the mechanization of motive power, of 
spinning and weaving, to a rapid building up of transportation- canals, bridges, 
and highways and to the revival of farming, the 'new husbandry.' 
u These remarks are based on earlier unpuhlisht,>{l studies by the author on the beginnings of ruling 
taste in painting. These types have their roots not in the French eirclc around Greuze, but in a circle 
of English painters and archeologists in Rome of the late 1760's.
