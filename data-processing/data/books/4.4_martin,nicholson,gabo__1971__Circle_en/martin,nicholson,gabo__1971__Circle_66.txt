UN KNOWN COLOUR 
By Winifred Dacre 
CoLOUR has been used chiefly in the past as a means to display form- form 
being thought of as its obvious master. 
The freedom of abstract thought has come, and shows us a future lying 
ahead of colour as one of the three great abstract arts. 
Mathematics-music-colour. To those artists whose inspiration comes in 
the form of shape and shape relationships, colour may continue to be the means 
of expressing those shapes, unless it be that they find that light and shade is a 
more suitable means for their purpose. 
But to those artists whose inspiration comes in the form of colour, of colour 
alone, without reference to object or object sense, it is no longer necessary to set 
about seeking some form into which the colour may be tagged to give it being. 
Naturally colour must have area, space-but let that area be directed by the 
needs of the colour itself and not by some consideration of form. A large blue 
square is bluer than a small blue square. A blue pentagon is a different blue 
from a triangle of the same blue. Let the blueness itself evolve the form which 
gives its fullest expression. This, the starting-point within secret artistic crea-

From thence, the breadth of the field of colour comes into view-its imÂ­
portance as yet little explored to abstract research. For abstract research a 
scale is invaluable upon which to base discoveries, and from which to measure 
them. Mathematics, with its number scale from one to infinity, has been up till 
now the medium of man's intellectual abstract thought. There is no scale of 
number discernible in nature. This was born within the intellect of man- not 
within his emotions, for there is no emotional quality in Mathematics. Music, 
with its scale from base to treble, has been the medium for abstract emotion. 
Its scale of sound is not audible in Nature and was discovered by the Spirit of
