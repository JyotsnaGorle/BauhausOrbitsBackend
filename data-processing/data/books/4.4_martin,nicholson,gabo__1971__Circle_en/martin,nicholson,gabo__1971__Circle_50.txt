PLASTIC ART AND PURE PLASTIC ART 
(Figurative Art and Non-Figurative Art) 
By Piet Mondrian 
PART I 
ALTHOUGH art is fundamentally everywhere and always the same, nevertheless 
two main human inclinations, diametrically opposed to each other, appear in 
its many and varied expressions. One aims at the direct creation of universal beauty, 
the other at the aesthetic expression of oneself, in other words, of that which one 
thinks and experiences. The first aims at representing reality objectively, the 
second subj ectively. Thus we see in every work of figurative art the desire, ob­
jectively to represent beauty, solely through form and colour, in mutually bal­
anced relations, and, at the same time, an attempt to express that which these 
forms, colours and relations arouse in us. This latter attempt must of necessity 
result in an individual expression which veils the pure representation ofbeauty. 
Nevertheless, both the two opposing elements (universal- individual) are in­
dispensable if the work is to arouse emotion. Art had to find the right solution. 
I n spite of the dual nature of the creative inclinations, figurative art has pro­
duced a harmony through a certain co-ordination between objective and sub­
jective expression. For the spectator, however, who demands a pure representa­
tion of beauty, the individual expression is too predominant. For the artist the 
search for a unified expression through the balance of two opposites has been, 
and always will be, a continual struggle. 
Throughout the history of culture, art has demonstrated that universal 
beauty does not arise from the particular character of the form, but from the 
dynamic rhythm of its inherent relationships, or-in a composition-from the 
mutual relations of forms. Art has shown that it is a question of determining 
the relations. It has revealed that the forms exist only for the creation of new
