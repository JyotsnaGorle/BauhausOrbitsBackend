CHOREOGRAPHY 
By Leonide Massine 
YouR questions interest me very much. They embrace the main problems of 
contemporary choreography. Taken collectively, they mean, 'In what direc足
tion is choreography heading?' I can answer only for myself, by referring to my 
own work and my own special way of resolving all the difficulties which every 
choreographer must face today. 
I should like to point out at the beginning, that choreography and the 
dance are not always one and the same thing. Whereas the dance certainly 
exists in choreography as an element, choreography as an art is something 
more than merely a dance. I still think that the classical choreography is one 
of the monumental bases for all the choreographic creations of today, and will 
be for a long time in the future, although I do not see why these classical prin足
ciples should not be enriched by new elements which correspond with the new 
spirit. I should say that the old classical choreography was more abstract than 
many of the newer forms of today. I can see a method of producing drama in 
choreography today without destroying the classical and purely abstract ele足
ments of the ballet, and this I try to do as far as possible. Certainly we choreo足
graphers are dependent to a large extent upon the human body and the nature 
of human impulses. We still cannot be so far abstract as to exclude the human 
body altogether from our art. In most choreography the human body is the 
first element, but it must be realized that this element can be used in such a 
way that it does not predominate over the pure choreographical idea; it may 
be compared with the material of a sculpture or with the colour used in 
painting. 
But we cannot regard choreographic art in the same way as painting or 
sculpture. Choreography is tightly linked to other kinds of art, for instance, to 
music and the art of the stage, so that its development tends to be slower and a
