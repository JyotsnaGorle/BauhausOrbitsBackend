CONSTRUCTION AND AESTH ETICS 
(Notes on the Reinforced-Concrete Bridges designed by the Swiss Engineer, 
Robert Mai /I art.) 
By Siegfried Giedion (English Version by P. Morton Shand) 
THOSE whose aesthetic sense has been formed or developed by the art of the 
present age can hardly fail to be stirred by Maillart's bridges, for their appear­
ance may be trusted to arrest them before they can even ask themselves why. 
But among public authorities the entire freedom from traditional aesthetic bias 
which characterizes their structure has called forth marked antipathy, miscon­
ception and resistance. 
Maillart's surprising designs, which attract some as much as they repel 
others, are the product of the uncompromising application of a new method of 
construction. They have almost as little in common with the solid arches, stout 
p1ers, and monumentally emphasized abutments of the usual 'massive' type 
of bridge as an airplane has with a mail coach. 
Although the first of his bridges have been standing these thirty years, and 
their adequacy for their purpose has long since ceased to be questioned, they 
still continue to arouse antagonism among local bodies, many of which regard 
them as positively hideous. It happened that most were built across remote 
Alpine valleys, where they were considerably cheaper to erect than other types 
and (an equally important consideration) comparatively few people would see 
them. The stark, lean assurance of their construction belies the aesthetic lights 
of a wide section of the public owing to its elimination of any emphasis on the 
means of support, and the taut, web-like appearance of the arch-spans which 
results. 'I am sick of these pastry-work bridges' was the way the chairman of 
one of these local bodies expressed his aversion. This remark is worth mention­
ing since it shows what an influence aesthetic feelings exercise alike on those
