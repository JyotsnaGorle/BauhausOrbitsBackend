This house, intended as a sports club, shows the change that has taken 
place in the plan under the influence of new methods of construction. Since the 
roof is carried on slender steel supports there is a complete freedom as far as the 
walls of the house are concerned. The different units are separated from one 
another either by cupboard units or by movable folding screens. This provides 
the highest degree of free space and the greatest possibility of variation. fhe 
training terrace can be united with the interior of the house by means of sliding 
glass screens. The indirect lighting achieved by movable reflectors, the furni­
ture made of resilient steel tubing, the cork floors, the soundproof sliding walls 
made of oilcloth, all these are made possible by the new materials.
