Slanting chimney smokes; a 
DIVER emerges from it; sinks 
head first into the water. 
Smoke puffing 
THE DIVER 
like a cauli­
flower, photo­
graphed over a 
bridge 
when a train 
is passing 
underneath. 
Propeller in the water in action. 
Mouths of the sewers under and 
above the surface of the water. By 
motor-boat through the canals to the 
garbage and refuse collection depot.
