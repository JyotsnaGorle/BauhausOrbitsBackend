Curve—free wave-like:
Variations of these last:
1. the high point directed toward the left giving way in the face of the
—
energetic attack of the negative pressure,
2. stress on the height through the broadening of the line—accentuation
(Fig.

Curve—free wave-like:
After the initial ascent toward the left, immediate, definite tension on a
large scale upwards and to the right. Relaxing to circular form toward
the left. Four waves are subordinated to one direction, from lower left to
1
upper right (Fig.
45).

Further discussion of the sound "right," "left," and its tensions will be found in the
section "Basic Plane."
The effects of right and left be investigated holding in front the
can by the book of
mirror; above and below, by turning the book upside-down.
The "reflection" and the "upside-down" are still rather mysterious facts which are of
great importance the theory composition.
