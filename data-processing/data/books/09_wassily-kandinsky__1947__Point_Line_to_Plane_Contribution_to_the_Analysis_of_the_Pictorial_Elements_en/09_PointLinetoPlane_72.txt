The parallel: diagonal red is here advanced as an assertion, the de- Red
tailed proof of which would lead too far afield from the subject of this

book. It may only briefly be stated: red is distinguished from yellow and
blue by its characteristic of lying firmly on the plane, and from black
and white by an intensive inner seething—a tension within it. The diagonal
reveals this difference from free straight lines: that it lies firmly on the
plane; and this difference from horizontals and verticals: that it has a
greater inner tension.
The point resting in the center of a square plane was defined above as

in a central position on a square plane would constitute further com-

plication of this case. These two straight lines are, already

said, solitary and alone, since they know no repetition. They
therefore develop a strong sound which can never be completely drowned
out and, thereby, represent the proto-sound of straight lines.

Red, grey and green, in certain relationships, can be placed on a parallel with each
other: red and green—transition from yellow to blue; grey—from black to white, etc.
This belongs in the field of colour theory. Suggestions concerning this are to be found
in "On the Spiritual in Art."
