It is in this manner that the three graphic techniques differ from
each
other, and in this manner that they are mutually interwoven.
Thus, the point—remaining always a point—takes on different
aspects
and is, thereby, a changing expression.
Texture remarks relate special
These last to the question of texture.
"texture" signifies
The term the manner in which the elements are exter-
nally combined with each other and with the basic plane. This mode of
combination depends on three factors which may be classified schemati-
cally as follows:
1. according to the character of the given space which may be smooth,
rough, flat, plastic, etc.,
2. according to the type of tool, whereby the one in common use today
in painting—the brush of various types—may be supplanted by other
tools, and
3. according to the manner of application: the colour may be laid on
loosely, compactly, stippling,
by by spraying, etc., depending upon
consistency—this
its accounts for the difference in binding media, pig-
ments, etc.
Even in the very limited field of the point, attention should be given to
texture possibilities (Figs. 12 and 13). Despite the narrowly drawn con-
fines of this smallest of elements, the different means of producing it are,
nevertheless, of importance, since the sound of the point takes on each
time a different colouration in accordance with the manner of its creation.
We have, therefore, to consider:
1. the character of the point as determined by the tool used to make it
with of the surface receiving (in this case,
in combination the nature it
the type of plate),
2. the character of the point in the way of its union with the surface finally
receiving it (in this case, the paper),
3. the character of the point as it depends upon the qualities of this defi-
50 nite surface itself (in this case, smooth, granular, striated, rough paper).
