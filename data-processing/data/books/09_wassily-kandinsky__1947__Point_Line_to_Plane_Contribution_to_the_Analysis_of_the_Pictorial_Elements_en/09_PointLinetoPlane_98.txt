At all events, one is here still completely dependent upon feeling.
A generally accepted distinction between line and plane is, for the present,
impossible—a fact which is perhaps bound up with the still little advanced
state of painting, as yet of an embryonic nature, if not possibly determined

Smooth, jagged, torn, rounded are attributes which in the imagination
create certain sensations of touch, due to which the outer borders of a
line, from a purely practical point of view, should not be underestimated.
With the line, the combination possibilities in the transference to touch
sensations are far more many-sided than with the point: for example,
smooth edges of a jagged line; jagged edges of a smooth, rounded line;
torn edges of a jagged line; torn edges of a rounded line; etc. All of these
characteristics can be used in the three types of lines—straight, angular
and curved—and each of the two sides can have a special treatment.

The means to this "approaching-of-the-boundary" extends far beyond the limits of
the problem of line-plane and into all the elements of painting and their application;
e.g., colour uses this means to a still greater extent, thereby possessing countless possi-
bilities. The basic plane, too, works with this medium which, together with the other
