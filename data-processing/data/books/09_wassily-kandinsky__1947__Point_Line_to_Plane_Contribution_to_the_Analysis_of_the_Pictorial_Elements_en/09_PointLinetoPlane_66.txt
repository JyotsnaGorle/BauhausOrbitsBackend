2. In complete contrast to this line, in both an external and inner sense, is
the vertical which stands at right angles to it, and in which flatness
is supplanted by height, and coldness by warmth. Therefore, the ver-
tical line is the most concise form of the potentiality for end-
less warm movement.
3. The third type of straight line is the diagonal which, in schematic form,
diverges from both of the above at the same angle and, therefore, has
the same inclination to both of them; a circumstance which determines
its inner soundâ€”equal union of coldness and warmth. Therefore, the
diagonal line is the most concise form of the potentiality for
endless cold-warm movement {Pigs. 14 and
15).

These three types are the purest forms of straight lines and they are differ- Tempera-

entiated from each other by temperature:
1. cold form, Most concise forms of

2. warm form, the potentiality for
movement.
3. cold-warm form. endless movement.
To a greater or smaller extent, all other straight lines are only deviations
from the diagonal. The differences in a greater or lesser tendency to cold-
ness or to warmth determine their inner sounds (Fig.
