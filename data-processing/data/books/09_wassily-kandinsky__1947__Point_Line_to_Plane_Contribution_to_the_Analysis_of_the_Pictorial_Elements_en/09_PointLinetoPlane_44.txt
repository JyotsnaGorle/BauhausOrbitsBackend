originated from points, to which point—in its original geometric essence—
everything returns. These are complexes of geometric points which, in
various configurations determined by physical laws, float in geometric
infinity. The smallest, self-contained, wholly centrifugal shapes actually
appear to the naked eye as points seemingly loosely related to each other.
Many seeds appear like this. In opening the beautiful, highly-polished,
ivory-like head of the poppy (in reality a somewhat large spherical point),
we discover heaps of cold blue-grey points arranged according to physical
law so as to form an ordered composition, and which carry within them-
selves the latently dormant generative power, as powerful as the pictorial
point.
Frequently, such forms arise in nature through the dismemberment and
decomposition of the above-mentioned complexes—the beginning, so to
speak, of a return to the primordial form of the geometric state. If the
desert is a sea of sand made up entirely out of points, the effect of the
uncontrollably-violent tendency of these "dead" points to shift is, not
without reason, terrifying.
And so also in nature, the point is a self-contained thing, full of
possi-
bilities (Figs. 5 and
6).
