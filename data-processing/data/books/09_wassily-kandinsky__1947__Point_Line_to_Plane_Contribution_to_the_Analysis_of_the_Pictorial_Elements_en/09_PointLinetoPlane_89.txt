a more more self-contained thing.
The straight line is capable of doing this, although, in contrast to the
curved line which can create a plane with two forces, it has need of three
impulses in plane creation. In the case of this new plane, beginning and
end cannot completely disappear, but are observable at three points.
Complete absence of the straight and the angular on the one hand and,
on the other hand, three straight lines with
three angles—these are the
signs of the two primary
planes which stand in the greatest contrast
to each other. Therefore, these two planes confront each other as
