that absolute black is inwardly unquestionably cold. It is not without reason
that the horizontal scale of colours runs from white to black (Fig. 21):

In addition in the case of white and black, the elements of height and
depth can be noted as coinciding with vertical and horizontal.
"Today" human beings are completely absorbed with the external; the
