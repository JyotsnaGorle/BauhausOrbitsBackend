Externally, the point may be defined as the smallest elementary
form, but Size
this definition is not exact. It is difficult to fix the exact limits of the con-
cept "smallest form." The point can grow and cover the entire ground
plane unnoticed—then, where would the boundary between point and
plane be?
There are two considerations to be borne in mind here:
point to size plane,
1. the relation of the size of the the of the and
of
2. the relative sizes of the point and the other forms on this plane.
basic
A form which, when on the otherwise empty plane, may still be con-
sidered to be a point, must be termed a plane when, for example, a very
thin line appears with it upon the basic plane (Fig.
2).

The relation of sizes in the first and second case
determines the concep-
tion of the point which, at present, can be tested on
the basis of feeling
only—since we lack an exact numerical expression
for it. 29
