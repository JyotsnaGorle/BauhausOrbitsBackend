This is a very simple and, at the same time, a very complex case, con-
cerning which I intend sometime to speak at length. It suffices here to
remark only that the simplicity as well as the complexity result from the
absence of angles. The circle is simple because the pressure of its bound-
aries by comparison with those of right-angled forms is equalized—the
differences are not so great. It is complex because the upper part overflows
imperceptably to the left and right, and the left and right flow downwards.
There are only four points which retain the decided sound of the four sides
which, furthermore, is quite clear from the standpoint of feeling.
These points are I, 4. The contrasts are same as in the right-
2, 3, the
angled forms: I 4 and 2 (Fig.
