This construction is, consequently, the prototype of linear
expression
or, of linear composition (Fig.

It consists of a square divided into four squares, the most primitive form
of the division of a schematic plane.
The sum of the tensions, consisting of 6 elements of cold rest and 6 ele-
ments of warm rest=l2. Therefore, the next step from the schematic
point picture to the schematic line picture is reached through a surpris-
ingly great increase of means: powerfully
the a single sound is amplified to
12 sounds. hand,
These 12 sounds, on the other consist of 4 sounds of the
plane =
+ 2 sounds of the line 6. The combination has doubled these 6
sounds.
This example, which is really part of the theory of composition, was given
here with the intention of suggesting the reciprocal effect of the simple
elements in elementary combinations, where the expression "elementary"
—in an imprecise, flexible sense—reveals the "relativity" of its nature.
