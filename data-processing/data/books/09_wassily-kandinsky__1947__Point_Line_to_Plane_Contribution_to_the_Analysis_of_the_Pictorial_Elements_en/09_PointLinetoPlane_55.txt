Means Hand-in-hand with the materials and tools of these three techniques
goes, naturally, the necessity of realizing the three different characteristics
of the point.
While paper can be used as material for these three different techniques,

the relation of the particular tool in each case is fundamentally different.
This accounts for the continued existence, side by side, down to the present
day of these three techniques.

basic plane can here remain entirely white, and in this white the points

definitely and with the greatest determination and bores eagerly into the
plate. The point is created first in the negative through a short, precise
prick in the plate.
