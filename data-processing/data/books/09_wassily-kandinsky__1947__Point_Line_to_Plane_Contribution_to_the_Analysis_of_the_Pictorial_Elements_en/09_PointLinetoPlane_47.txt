The Dance Already in the classical ballet form existed "points" a designated
terminology which unquestionably is derived from "point." The rapid
running on the toes leaves behind on the floor a trace of points. The
ballet dancer leaps to a point above, clearly aiming at it with his head
and, in landing, again contacts a point on the floor. High leaps in the
modern dance can, in some cases, be compared with the "classic"
ballet's
high leap; that, whereas the leap formerly pointed straight, vertical
to a
direction, "modern" frequently forms five-pointed
the leap a plane with
its five extremities—head, two feet and two hands, whereby the ten
fingers form ten smaller points (e.g., the dancer Palucca, Fig. Further-
9).
more, the brief states of rigid immobility can be looked upon as points.
Thus we have active and passive point formations which bear a relation-
ship to the musical form of the point.
