Graphic In that particular field of painting known as graphic, the point develops

its autonomous powers with special clarity: the material tools offer to these
powers many different possibilities in the way of diversity of form and
size, which establishes the point in countless entities with different sound
values.
Techniques Even here, multiplicity
this and diversity are easily classified when the
special characteristics of the graphic techniques are used in this classi-
fication.
The typical graphic techniques are:
1. etching, particularly dry-point,
2. the woodcut, and
3. lithography.
The differences between these three techniques stand out with exceptional
clarity in connection with the point and its creation.
Etching In etching, naturally, the smallest black point can be obtained with the
greatest of ease while, on the other hand, only with considerable effort
and various tricks can a large white point be obtained.
The situation in the woodcut is entirely opposite. The smallest white points

need only one stab. It is the large black point which demands effort and
consideration.
lithography
Lithography In both roads are equally smooth and effort is eliminated.
Likewise, the possibilities of making corrections differ in these three tech-
niques: in etching, strictly speaking, correction is impossible; in the wood-
cut it is restricted and, in lithography, it is unlimited.
Atmos- It should be evident from this comparison of the three techniques, that the
phere
lithographic process was bound to be the last discovered; in fact, since the
discovery did not take place until "today," facility cannot be attained
without effort. On the other hand, ease in creating and ease in correcting

day. The
