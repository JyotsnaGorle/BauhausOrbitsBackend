1. the cold and controlled,
2. the sharp and highly active, and
3. the clumsy, weak and passive.
These three sounds and, therefore, these three angles, give a fine graphic
translation of the artistic process:
sharp active the inner thought (vision),

3. the unsatisfied feeling and the sensation of one's own weakness follow-

parallels of angular lines with colours must be indicated. The cold-warm
of the square and its definite plane-like nature, immediately become sign-
posts pointing to red, which represents a midway point between yellow

and blue and carries within it cold-warm characteristics. Not without
reason has the red square appeared so often of late. It is not, therefore,
completely without justification right
that the angle is placed on a parallel
with red.
Under class d) of angular lines, it is necessary to emphasize a special

angle which lies between the right and acute angles—an angle of
- 30°
(right angle and acute + 15°). When the openings of two such
angles are brought together, they produce an equilateral triangle—three
