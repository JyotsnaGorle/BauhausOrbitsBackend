The capacities of one
man seldom allow the handling
of more than one
problem
area. I suspect this
is why my work since those
days has been only a
paraphrase of
the original
problem, light. I became interested
in painting-with-light,
not on the sur-
face of
canvas, but directly in space.
Painting transparencies was
the start. I painted
as if colored
light was projected
on a screen, and other colored
lights superimposed
over
it. I thought this effect
could be enhanced by
placing translucent screens
of
different shapes,
one behind the other, and
projecting the colored lights
over each
unit. Although
at the time I was without
the necessary skill and
means, this idea was
responsible, with some
changes, for my later
experiments with stage sets
and with
molded transparent
plastics.
My
transparent pictures around
1921 became completely
freed of elements remi-
niscent
of nature. The liberation
from the necessity
to record was their genesis. I
wanted
to
eliminate all factors
which might disturb —
their clarity in contrast, for
example, with
Kandinsky
s paintings, which reminded
me sometimes of an undersea
world. My desire
was to
work with the peculiar
1920. Gloss architecture. characteristics of colors, with
their pure relationships.
I
chose simple geometrical
forms as a step towards
such objectivity. I
see today that
this step was the logical
continuation of
the cubist paintings that
I had admiringly
studied.
After my earlier
experiments with black and
white and colored strips, with
related
small and large
areas of different colors,
I found that the cubists, in their
col-
lages, had already
touched upon such schemes.
To me it was disturbing that
the cubists
had named
such pictures “Still Life
with Mandolin’*, “Head”,
or “Nude”. Now I realize
that
their clinging to subject-matter
was inevitable. First,
because of the convention
that
every painting must
be rooted in nature. Second,
because new developments for
them
took place only
step by step as a result of
the disintegration of the original
stimulus.
Tearing
apart the old visual
conception, the cubist painters
originated a new means of
rendering, as well as
a space articulation. The
cubists hoped to develop a method
to
penetrate reality more
thoroughly than had
been possible with perspective-illusion.
They had an
intimation of the coming forceful
visual monopoly of the movies,
and
tried
to escape from it by all means.
The principle of the motion picture
was a new
method of rendering three-dimensional
reality. The film was able to show
any object in
space from many different
sides in quick succession. The
cubists began to produce such

1936. Special effects for the motion picture "Things to
a rendering by looking
around the corner,” and looking —
from above, from every side
invalidating
the monocular vision of previous
painters.
In the first place, the
spectator's surprise came, to a great extent,
from distortions
of recognizable
objects and from the wit with which these
deviations from the habitual
rendering of
nature were used for a binocular
characterization of the object. Besides
the emotional upheaval caused
by the startling extension of the
traditional pictorial
elements into a new vision,
the distortions and strange
transformations of well-known
subject matter produced,
in addition, an attack on all
pictorial fixations originating in
the
renaissance. The analysis of the
binocular vision in motion led the
cubists to render
objects with a multitude of details
seen from every point of view.
For this they employed
a method of dissolving
the whole shape into small
geometric units, and saw to it that
the multitude
of elements did not destroy
the original subject as an entity.
To do this
clearly,
the cubists devised a method
of having small shapes cast
shadows within the
large area of the
original shape. A little painting of
playing-cards by Braque in 1910
shows this —
method which Cezanne had already
employed in some of his watercolors.
When playing-cards are lying flat,
they do not cast shadows,
but the more the cards
are lifted, the more shadow
they cast.
