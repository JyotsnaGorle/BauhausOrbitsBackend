In working with these —

I made discoveries
which were
instrumental in changing my painting

This had
inevitable repercussions on my
thinking concerning light problems.
To produce
true,
primary relationships, my former
idea of an “objective" painting,
was not the only
reason for my use of smooth
flat surfaces. It was also nearest
to the transition of
light
into color and color into
light, something like an
objective texture invention for
a delicate
and evasive
medium. By producing real
radiant light effects through transparent
dyes
on plastic
and through other means,
one has no need for translating
light into color
by
painting with pigment.
Light painting had arrived
and with it, the problem of texture
reasserted itself.
Painting with light.
There has been in the past a period
of light painting, that of
stained-glass
windows. There, direct and reflected
light and the shadow of the framing
combined with
projected colored light
into a fascinating visual unity. Our technology
offers new
possibilities, no less
impressive, and without imitating the old
techniques.
At
present the central problem
of painting on transparent sheets the
is reality of direct
light
effects. In my first
experiments I learned that I must
have a screen upon which
the light
effects of the painting could be
projected. So I mounted the painted sheet
several
inches in front of plain white
or light gray backgrounds. There I observed that
solid shapes on transparent
sheets cast solid shadows. To dissolve and articulate
the
heavy shadows one
has to employ various means. There is possibility

the surface with
fine lines of different density which throw
shadows of varied gray
values on the
screen, similar to the fine gradations
of grays in the photogram. To
paint
stripes similar to grill- or lattice-work,
or to perforate solid surfaces, is another
possibility. Such elements, if lighted,
cast alternating shadow and light patterns on the
background behind
the painted surface. Upon these patterns the original
painting is
*
superimposed. If
lighted from the side, the shapes of the original
and its shadows
appear shifted, creating a new relationship between
the colors and their gray shadows.
This intensifies considerably the effect of
the usual shadowless paintings. It produces
automatically a "light texture,"
especially if transparent dyes are used instead of
pigments. The results,
although very pleasing, bring some danger with them.
The
smooth
perfection of the plastics, their light-flooded, sparkling
planes, could easily
lure
one into an effective but decorative performance.
I attempted to avoid this, espe-
cially when remembering my Louvre and Vatican
