Bones are coordinated to form the skeleton.
Even at rest they depend on mutual support.
This is furnished by the ligaments.
Theirs is a secondary function; one could speak of a hierarchy of
function.
The next step in motoric organization leads from bone to muscle.
The tendon is the mediary between these two.
Structural concept in nature:
The grouping of the smallest recognizable
entities in matter:
Bone matter is cellular or tubular.
Ligament structure is a sinuous-fibrous
web.
Tendons are continuous with the connec
tive tissue of the muscle, strengthened
by cross grain.
