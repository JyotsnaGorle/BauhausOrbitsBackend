The independence of the muscle function is, of course, relative. It
applies only in relationship to bone function. Actually the muscle
is not independent but obeys orders, issued from the brain. It does
not want to act; or, at best, it wants to obey. The transmission of
a brain order can be compared to a telegram, with nerves acting
as wires.
In order to visualize the relative interrelationship of serving and
commanding, or of structural to individual function, fig. 24 pre
sents a diagram comparable to nesting toy boxes.
And what is the relationship of muscle to bone?
Through its ability to contract or shorten itself, the muscle brings
two bones into a new angular relationship.
If one considers further the realm of kinetic organisms, one com
prehends in the relationship of bone to muscle the mediary
function of the tendon.
The position of two bones toward each other must change if the
muscle so decides.
Muscle function supersedes bone function; in relationship to muscle
function, the bone function is passive.
Bones give support to the total organism; also when in motion.
Muscles have a higher function because they act beside each other.
One bends, the other stretches.

toward the center; in on arrangement according to measurement. the brain would have to occupy
the (peripheral) place of the greatest spatial expansion, and the position of the motoric faculties would
be reversed.
