The spinning top.
A scale, deprived of its material support, and reduced to one point of
contact, will topple and fall, even if its weight has been carefully
distributed (Fig. 60):
Horizontal
gyration will
save this toy
from falling.
This is the
principle of
the spinning
top. (Fig. 61.)
A double top will even dance on
a taut string without falling (Fig.
62).
