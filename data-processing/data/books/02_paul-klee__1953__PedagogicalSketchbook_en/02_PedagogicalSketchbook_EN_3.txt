INTRODUCTION
by Sibyl Moholy-Nagy
"For the artist communication with nature remains the
most essential condition. The artist is human; himself
nature; part of nature within natural space."
This statement, written in 1923 by Paul Klee, was the Leitmotif of a
creative life that derived almost equal inspiration from painting and
from music. Man painted and danced long before he learned to write
and construct. The senses of form and tone are his primordial heritage.
Paul Klee fused both of these creative impulses into a new entity. His
forms are derived from nature, inspired by observation of shape and
cyclic change but their appearance only matters in so far as it sym
bolizes an inner actuality that receives meaning from its relationship to
the cosmos. There is a common agreement among men on the place
and function of external features: eye, leg, roof, sail, star. In Paul Klee's
pictures they are used as beacons, pointing away from the surface into
a spiritual reality. Just as a magician performs the miraculous with ob
jects of utter familiarity, such as cards, handkerchiefs, coins, rabbits, so
Paul Klee uses the familiar object in unfamiliar relationships to mate
rialize the unknown.
The Symbolic Expressionists and the Cubists during the first decade of
the Twentieth Century had already questioned the validity of Academic
Naturalism. Their painting had looked below the surface with the
analytical eye of psychology and x-ray. But the multi-layered figures of
Kirchner and Kokoschka or the simultaneous views of Braque and
Picasso, were analytical-statements, resting statically on the canvas.
Klee's figures and forms are not only transparent, as if seen through a
fluoroscope; they exist in a magnetic field of cross currents: lines, forms,
splotches, arrows, color waves. As if it were a symphonic composition,
the main motif moves from variation to variation in its relationship to
other objects on the canvas. A bird in THE TWITTERING MACHINE, for
instance, is different from all other birds through its relationship to
transmission belt, crank shaft, and musical notations, floating in the air.
Without contradicting himself, Klee could confess to "communication
