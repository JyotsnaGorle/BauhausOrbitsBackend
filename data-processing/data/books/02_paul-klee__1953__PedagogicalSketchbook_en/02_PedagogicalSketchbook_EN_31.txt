A concluding note
The beacon, guiding Klee through his adventures in seeing, is the line
in action. The dot, extended into a graphic curve, cannot come to rest
on the last page of the Sketchbook. It urges on to further explorations,
both in space and spirit. For the teacher who wants to respond to this
incentive, a complete program is indicated in the four subdivisions:
I:
Line as point progression
Line as planar definition
Line as mathematical proportion
Line as coordinator for the path of motion
II:
Line as optical guide
Line as optical reason
Line as psychological balance
III:
Line as energy projection
IV:
Line as symbol of centrifugal and centripedal movement
Line as symbol of will and infinity
Line as symbol of color mutations and kinetic harmony
There are endless phenomena all around us on which to aim Klee's
ideas like a searchlight. The "line on a walk" can produce new rhythmic
curves. Any surface offers itself for definition through line-connected
points. Klee's examples of coordinated linear motion: bone and muscle,
blood stream, waterfall, can be supplemented by the vertical extension
of bird flight, the horizontal motion of the tides, the circular rhythm of
tree rings. The optical perceptions and illusions of each student form
the framework of his security. But has he observed their pattern as they
relate him to the experiences of physical height, spatial distance, for
ward motion, light and dark contrasts? What does he actually see and
what are the optical facts? And there is the intimate and instinctual
identification of object and meaning which Klee defines through the two
arrows, the spinning top, the shooting star. Many other examples can
