that Dr. Gropius h ad developed the hints and 
uggestions in hi e ay on this subject. It is a 
tical ~tudy for this moment. At one time I 
cri
thought that maybe architects had limited the 
scope of their training too narrowly in relating 
it to building, especially when I saw them ven足
turing into other fields of design such as furni足
ture, decoration, pottery and so forth, but I see 
now that I was not right. The designer for in足
dustry must be placed alongside the architect, 
'vith a training equivalent in character, if 
directed towards another end, and vvith a status 
and authority equivalent too. Dr. Gropius must 
help to define this training and to explore its 
methods, once more repeating the experiments 
of the Bauhaus, with architecture as a mistress 
art certainly, but also with a new architectonic 
arising out of a collective understanding of de足
sign in industry.
