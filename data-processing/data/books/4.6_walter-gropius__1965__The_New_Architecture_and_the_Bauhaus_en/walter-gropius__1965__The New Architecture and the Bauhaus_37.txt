site. The dislocation which the seasonal charac­
ter of building operations causes employers and 
employed alike as, indeed, the community at 
large is being gradually overcome. Continuous 
activity throughout the year will soon become 
the rule instead of the exception. 
And just as fabricated materials have been 
evolved vvhich are superior to natural ones in ac­
curacy and uniformity, so modern practice in 
house construction is increasingly approximat­
ing to the successive stages of a n1anufacturing 
process. We are approaching a state of techni­
cal proficiency when it will become possible to 
rationalize buildings and mass-produce them 
in factories by resolving their structure into 
a number of component parts. Like boxes of 
toy bricks, these will be assembled in various 
formal compositions in a dry state : which means 
that building will definitely cease to be depend­
ent on the weather. Ready-made houses of solid 
fireproof construction, that can be delivered fully 
equipped from stock, will ultimately become 
one of the principal products of industry. Before 
this is practicable, however, every part of the 
house floor-beams, wall-slabs, windows, doors, 
and fittings will have to be normed.
