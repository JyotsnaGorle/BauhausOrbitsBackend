thread of an organic process of production as 
the factory-worker inevitably does. Intimate 
contact between the various Bauhaus work­
shops and those of industrial concerns were de­
liberately cultivated as being of mutual advan­
tage.1 In the latter he obtained a superior degree 
of technical knowledge, and also learned the 
hard lesson that commercial insistence on the 
fullest utilization of time and plant was some­
thing which has to be taken directly into ac­
count by the modern designer. That respect for 
stern realities which is one of the strongest 
bonds between workers engaged on a common 
task speedily dissipated the misty aestheticism 
of the academies. 
After three years' practical training the ap­
prentice had to execute a design of his own 
1 By agreement with certain manufacturing firms, our ripest 
and most promising apprentices were sent to work for short 
periods in factories whose products corresponded with the parti­
cular branches of industrial design taught in the workshops they 
happened to be attached to at the Bauhaus. There they studied 
current industrial methods of production, manufacturing pro­
cesses, price calculations, and possibilities for improving existing 
models and introducing new ones. The special knowledge they 
acquired in this way enabled them to be assigned to our Research 
Station on their return. In it they worked out new models under 
their former masters to meet the particular technical require­
ments of the firms they had been sent to. They further assisted 
these firms by keeping in close contact with the preparations for 
adjusting their machinery to produce them.
