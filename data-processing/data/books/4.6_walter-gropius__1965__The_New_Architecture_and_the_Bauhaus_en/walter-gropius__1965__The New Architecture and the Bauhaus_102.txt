Diagrams illustrating the Development of a Rectangular 
with Parallel Rows of Tenement-Blocks of 
Building-Site 
Different 1-Ieights 
In the two comparative diagrams above, the interval between 
the blocks, though varying according to then umber of their floors 
(2, 3, 4 , 5, 6 and 10 respectively), has in every case been fixed so 
as to give the same (30 degrees) angle of light from the ground­
line of one block to the roof-parapet of that standing next to it. 
R esult: \iVith an identical angle of light the number of beds 
45 square feet of living-space to each bed- i.e. per 
(reckoning 
inhabitant) increases with the number of floors; the 1200 beds of 
the ten three-storied blocks mounting to a total of 1700 in the 
four ten-storied ones. 
The two comparative diagrams on the opposite page illustrate 
how an identical amount of living-space (reckoning 160 square 
feet per head) can be provided on sites of equal area by blocks of 
different heights (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10 floors respectively); the 
density of population therefore remaining the same.
