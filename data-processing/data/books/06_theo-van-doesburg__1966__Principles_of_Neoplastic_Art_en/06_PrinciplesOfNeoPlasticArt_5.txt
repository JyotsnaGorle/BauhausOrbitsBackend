is this that has given their utterances their rigorously abstract character. 
This is a gain which ought not to be underestimated, yet it has the draw足
back that for most laymen this kind of introduction is almost as difficult 
to understand as the work itself. Consequently this manner of elucidation 
failed of its practical purpose. 
Responsibility for present-day non-comprehension of the visual arts 
lies as much with the artist-theoretician as with the observer: the ob足
server, because art is for him a matter to which he probably does not give 
so much as a few moments' thought daily and because from the first he 
has had no doubt that art gives pleasure but demands no effort whatever. 
The artist-theoretician, because only rarely is he concerned with any足
thing apart from art and he takes the point of view that it is not for him to 
descend to the level of the public (which is, of course, unnecessary, indeed 
impossible, where his creative work is concerned), but for the public to 
aspire to his. 
Yet how is the public to lift itself to the artist's level if the artist does 
not help; if, in other words, the artist does not help the public to see, hear, 
and understand his works. 
The public has its own, proper interior and exterior worlds, the artist 
has others. The two differ so greatly that it is impossible to pass from the 
one to the other. 
The artist speaks from within his interior and the exterior worlds in 
words and images which come easily to him because they are elements of 
the world in which he alone belongs. The public's worlds, however, are 
totally different and the words with which it expresses its ideas are en足
tirely characteristic of its own world. 
The perceptions of different people, each of whom inhabit different 
interior and exterior worlds, clearly cannot coincide. Examples will follow. 
Suffice it now to show how even a single phrase used by people of different 
environments gives rise to totally different interpretations.
