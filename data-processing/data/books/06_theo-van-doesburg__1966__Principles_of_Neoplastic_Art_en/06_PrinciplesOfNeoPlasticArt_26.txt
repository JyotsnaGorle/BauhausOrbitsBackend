XVII. Only the active, creative experience can generate a work of 
art, not the passive. 
XVIII. The passive experience can only produce a repetition or 
duplicate of the object of the experience. 
Between these two poles of experience lies every possible degree, from 
art to non-art. The whole of artistic development towards the unam­
biguous embodiment of the aesthetic experience of reality moves between 
these two possible modes of experience. 
The work of art emerges as reaction (see First Chapter, Point IV) from 
the active, creative experience. 
The artist will also react strongly to a stronger creative experience. In 
order to be able to express the experience he will reach for the expres­
sional means that will in fact realize his experience. 
The expressional means will automatically be the characteristic expres­
sional means of every art•). 
When the artist repeats the object of his experience, stamping this dupli­
cate with the mark of his temperament, this form of expression always 
remains to a greater or lesser degree inferior to the direct form of expres­
sion. This form of expression remains secondary, unclear, undefined. 
It is not a direct realization, not an exact form of expression for the 
artistic idea, it is only a substitute. 
XIX. The artist can produce a direct realization, an exact form of 
expression only through and from within his formative means. 
The artistic idea is formatively embodied in every art through its own 
creative means as material (see Second Chapter, Point XII ). 
Art - visual art, music and especially painting - has to express the 
formative idea in its own way, with its own means. Obviously we cannot 
accurately describe the creative idea (the aesthetic moment). To clarify 
e ) In my work on aesthetics 'Die neue Gestaltungslehre' ('La doctrine de !'art n ouveau') I have tried t o 
reduce the elementary expressional means of v isual art to a common denominator.
