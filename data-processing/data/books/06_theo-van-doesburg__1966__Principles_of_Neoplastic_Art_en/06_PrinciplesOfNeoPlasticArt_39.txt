work of art ·the observer does not perceive specific, that is dominant, 
details. The impression is rather one of complete equality of importance of 
\ all the parts, a concept which concerns not only these parts as such, but 
\ must be carried over to the relationship between the observer and the work 
of art. Difficult though it is to express in words the effect of a work of art, 
the observer's deepest perception is still best described by saying that a 
balancing of the subjective and the objective takes place within him, 
directly imbued with an emergent awareness, and he experiences a sense 
of clarity, of simultaneous height and depth, which has no connexion with 
natural relationships or spatial dimensions, a perception which removes the 
observer to a state of conscious harmony, in which the action of separate 
do min ants is resolved. 
It is not impossible that this artistic vision resembles religious harmony 
or exaltation, because the inmost essence is expressed in the work of art, 
but with the fundamental difference that artistic contemplation, emergent 
awareness and exaltation - in a word: the pure artistic experience - has 
nothing fanciful and vague about it ; on the contrary: the true artistic 
experience is wholly real and conscious. 
Genuine artistic experience cannot be passive for the observer is com­
pelled as it were to experience with the artist the continual and repeated 
exchange and cancelling out of position and dimension, lines and planes. 
He will understand how harmonious relationships finally spring from this 
play of recurrent exchange and cancelling out of one element by another. 
Each part unites with other parts. The formative unity of the whole grows 
out of all the parts (but single parts of the whole do not dominate and 
stand out). 
A perfect equilibrium of artistic relationships has been achieved. There 
is nothing to deflect the observer ; he is free to participate in it.
