FOURTH CHAPTER 
EXPRESSION AND EXPRESSIONAL MEANS 
OF THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 
If we look attentively at early works of art, we shall be struck by the 
fact that even in the most primitive drawings there are two differing styles 
of expression. These modes of expression correspond to the differences in 
the outward form of the reality. One consists in a mode of expression which 
. 
is confined entirely to externally perceived objects or phenomena, and the 
;I' 
other in a profounder mode of expression in which the externally per­
ceived objects serve tonl~ to suggest thoughts or feelings. 
In the first instance the object is the goal of the mode of expression, in 
the second only the means. Thus we may briefly label the first mode: 'Ex­
pression of matter', the second 'Expression of idea' (Fig. 18-19). 
At periods when the view of life has been materialistic, art has been 
materialistic too. All it has done has been to imitate the material aspect of 
objects. At periods when the view of life has been more inward, natural, 
external forms have been used only as auxiliary means for expressing an 
idea or a feeling (see First Chapter, Points 11•-V). 
Materialistic art is entirely restricted to physical forms, it awakens in us 
an idea of the material beauty of these forms. Ideal art uses these forms, 
certainly; but it uses them as a vessel for ideas or emotions, in order to 
awaken the experience of a more inward beauty. 
Leaving aside the question as to how far materialistic painting• ) is art, 
it is clear that ideal painting is a more valuable kind of artistic expression 
\ 
e ) We might also use the terms imitative and creative art.
