undergoes does not correspond to his material needs, the object leaves him 
cold. Because he is restricted by the limits of sensory experience, all ob­
jects which call for a deeper perception will lie outside his 'world' and will 
therefore simply not exist for him•), whereas a sausage would immediately 
awaken all his faculties of perception. 
IV. Perception and vital experience mutually determine one 
another. 
If the perception is external, sensory, so too is the experience external, 
sensory. 
If the perception is more inward, psychic, so too is the experience more 
1nward, psychic. 
If after an experience of the senses (e.g., in the presence of an object) 
a process takes place in the psyche (during or after apprehension), we can 
say that this experience is not merely a sensory one. In this case the sen­
sory experience is only a means to a deeper experience of reality. 
If as a result of this process an even deeper experience of reality ensues, 
so that the individual is rationally aware of its content, we have an in­
tellectual experience of reality. 
The reaction of the vital experience corresponds to the character of the 
vi tal experience. 
V. If the vital experience is intellectual, i.e. if experience of the 
environment is not exclusively restricted to the sensory or the 
psychic, the reaction will correspond to the vital experience. 
The individual will react to the environment differently from the dog 
in Example 2. The dog reacts in a purely material, practical manner. 
e ) From th1s we may conclude that there is no positive reality. 'Reality' for each individual is only his 
relationship with his environment ; and in fact his relationship is det ermined by the limits of his possi­
bilities of experience.
