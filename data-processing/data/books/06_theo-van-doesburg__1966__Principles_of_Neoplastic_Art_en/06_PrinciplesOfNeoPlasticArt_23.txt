(assuming that the aim of art lies beyond the repetition of the outward 
form of things having a real existence in nature). 
In the course of its development, visual art has increasing! y striven to 
transcend exact reproduction of perceived objects and external forms. 
Art has followed many trails in its endeavour to win a territory exclusively 
its own, but artists have not been alive to the fact that art can attain its 
goal only on its own ground. 
The primary goal of art is to be art. Visual art has to Â·form (gestalten). 
Every objection raised against this statement can be met with its logical 
reply if we associate ourselves with the concept of Gestaltung (formation) 
and ask what art has to form . 
Formation is direct, unambiguous expression realized by pure artistic 
means. 
The content which has to be formed is the aesthetic experience of 
reality. (Artistic balancing of all the formative values.) 
Form is related to the content it expresses as the body is to the psyche. 
As soon as art deviates from its nature and ceases only to 'embody' 
formatively, but illustrates, i.e., gives direct instead of indirect expression 
t o the aesthetic experience, it becomes impure and loses its unambiguous 
power. 
Every work of art is preceded by an inward or outward experience of 
reality as dict ated by the vital consciousness. The ideal and the material 
forms of expression correspond to the two modes of experience. 
In materialist art perception is confined to the object; in ideal art 
perception has transcended this limit. This depends on a people's attitude 
to life, whether it is predominantly superficial (natural) or more profound 
(spiritual) . 
We observe that among the Egyptians art was predominantly ideal. 
Forms and colours are determined by the degree of inwardness of the vital 
consciousness; forms and colours become more definite and more basic.
