FIFTH CHAPTER 
THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE OBSERVER 
TO THE WORK OF ART 
Art is expression. Ex2!_essign _ of our artistic experience of reality. For­
mative (visual) art is formative expression with formative means. 
The art of music is musical expression with musical means. 
Some people are capable of understanding this expression immediately 
and without preparation, others need intellectual preparation and special 
initiation. An unconscious or subconscious relationship with the work of 
art does not satisfy them, they want a clearly conscious attitude. 
In order to acquire this conscious relationship with the work of art, 
which, as emerges from this study, can obviously be only a consciously 
artistic one, it is necessary to grasp the concept of formative art in its fun­
damental significance as we have explained it in the foregoing chapters. 
These show that in exact, formative art it is possible to express the 
artistic experience of reality simply and solely with the means proper to 
each branch of art- in painting, for example, with colour and its relation­
ship to the picture plane. Anyone who doubt~ this possibility had better 
keep to indirect art, which is only secondarily 'formative', in which the 
artistic idea is uncertainly expressed because other combinations of ideas 
are present. 
Those who do not doubt this possibility must, from the historical and 
aesthetic point of view, regard this exact, formative art as the logical 
continuation of the development of visual art up to this time. In the visual 
)< 
art which has existed until now, the artist has not confined himself to 
formative means but has used other means as well.
