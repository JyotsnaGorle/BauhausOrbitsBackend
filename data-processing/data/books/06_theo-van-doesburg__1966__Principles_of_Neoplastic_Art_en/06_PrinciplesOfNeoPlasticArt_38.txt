understanding of the true work of art, The Night Watch and an official 
group-portrait by Troost, in the case of Rembrandt and Troost, would 
be essentially in the same class. But, essentially, their work is totally 
dissimilar. With Rembrandt, light , silk, etc. are the means of expression (of 
an artistic and aesthetic attitude), with Cornelis Troost the representation 
of the silk is the aim. 
Rembrandt sought, by means of darkness and light, to suggest a space 
formation which is painterly and different from feal space. Cornelis Troost 
wished to simulate silk by means of colour. 
Now when somebody looking at a painting by Rembrandt observes the 
way in which the painter uses repeated exchanges, interpenetration, and 
the cancelling out of one element by another (in this instance of light 
by darkness, colour by contrasting colour, et c. ) and sees therein the 
painterly formation after which Rembrandt was striving as it were really 
'coming into existence', he has apprehended the artistic root of the paint- J 
ing. In this manner the observer himself shares inwardly in the creation 
and to this extent the process may be described as a new re-creation in the 
consciousness of the observer. 
This, the creative way, is the only true way of looking at visual art. 
There is none other, either for classical or for modern art. 
In classical art the artistic aim is more or less concealed behind super­
vening auxiliary means. In modern art the artistic aim always appears with 
greater clarity, greater exactitude. There are always fewer anecdotes and 
borrowings from nature to deflect the observer from the artistic aim and 
thus the demand upon him to re-create the ·work anew (the aesthetic 
re-creative activity) is stronger. He must adopt a more active attitude 
towards the work of art if he wishes to understand it properly.
