"legitimate" theater. This self-restriction does not come from a feeling of 
resignation but from the realization that by intensifying our work in such a 
limited area, in contrast to the ambitions of the state-supported opera and 
theater, we have the considerable double advantage of being free from the 
external restrictions of the latter (restrictions which often go far toward 
actually vitiating the artistic) and therefore of being able to give freer rein to 
imagination, invention, and technical execution. Our aim, further, is to cre- 
ate a different sort of play from those of others with whom we are often com- 
pared (for example, Tairoff and The Bl~ebird).~ On the one hand, the na- 
tional quality of our work is to be a native, an inherent one. On the other 
hand (and in no sense a contradiction), ours is a search for that which is 
universally valid for the creative theater. If we care to look for models, they 
can be found in the Javanese, the Japanese, and the Chinese theater, rather 
than in the European theater of today. 
The point of our endeavor: 
To become a traveling company of actors which will perform its works 
wherever there is a desire to see them. 
6 Alexander Tairoff (a pseudonym for Alexander Kornbliet, 1885-1950) was the 
creator in 1914 of the Moscow Kamerny Theater (Kammertheater) which, in contrast to 
both the naturalism and symbolism of Stanislavski's stage, promoted an expressive, 
mimetic-decorative theater style influenced by Cubism and Constructivism. The guest 
performances of Tairoff's theater exerted a strong influence outside Russia. Schlem- 
mer's reference to The Bluebird has to do with one of the famous productions of the 
Moscow Art Theater under Constantin Stanislavski: Maurice Maeterlinck's L'Oiseau 
bleu had its world premier there in 1908 and, as a prized example of Symbolism on the 
stage, toured Europe in repertory with that company for several years; it was still being 
given in Moscow in 1924. (Translator)
