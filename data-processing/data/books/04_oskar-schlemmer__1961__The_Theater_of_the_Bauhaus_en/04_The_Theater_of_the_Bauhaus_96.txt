Light Play, with Proiectionr and Translucent Effects.

Since, moreover, we are not concerned with imitating nature and for 
this reason use no painted flats or backdrops to transplant a kind of second- 
rate nature onto the stage - since we have no interest in make-believe 
forests, mountains, lakes, or rooms - we have constructed simple flats of 
wood and white canvas which can be slid back and forth on a series of paral- 
lel tracks and can be used as screens for light projection. By back-lighting 
we can also make them into translucent curtains or wall areas and thereby 
achieve an illusion of a higher order, created directly from readily avail- 
able means (illustrations 8, 9). We do not want to imitate sunlight and 
moonlight, morning, noon, evening, and night with our lighting. Rather we 
let the light function by itself, for what it is: yellow, blue, red, green, violet, 
and so on. Why should we embellish these simple phenomena with 
such preconceived equations as: red stands for madness, violet for the 
mystical, orange for evening, and so on? Let us rather open our eyes and 
expose our minds to the pure power of color and light. If we can do this, 
we shall be surprised at how well the laws of color and its mutations can be 
demonstrated by the use of colored light in the physical and chemical labo- 
ratory of the theater stage. With nothing more than simple stage lighting,
