detaching it from its source, and can enlarge it beyond its dimensional and 
temporal limitations. 
The material of the formative artist - painter, sculptor, architect - 
is form and color. 
These formative means, invented by the human mind, can be called 
abstract by virtue of their artificiality and insofar as they represent an under- 
taking whose purpose, contrary to nature, is order. Form is manifest in ex- 
tensions of height, breadth, and depth; as line, as plane, and as solid or 
volume. Depending on these extensions, form becomes then linear frame- 
work, wall, or space, and, as such, rigid - i.e., tangible - form. 
LINE PLANE SOLID (Volume) 
Non-rigid, intangible form occurs as light, whose linear effect appears 
in the geometry of the light beam and of pyrotechnical display, and whose 
solid- and space-creating effect comes through illumination.
