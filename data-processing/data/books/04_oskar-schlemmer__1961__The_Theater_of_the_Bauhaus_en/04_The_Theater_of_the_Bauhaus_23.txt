formed back into nature or the imitation of nature. This happens in the 
theater of illusionistic realism. 
Or natural man, in deference to abstract space, is recast to fit its mold. 
This happens on the abstract stage. 
The laws of cubical space are the invisible linear network of planimetric 
and stereometric relationships. (See above sketch.) This mathematic cor- 
responds to the inherent mathematic of the human body and creates its 
balance by means of movements, which by their very nature are determined 
mechanically and rationally. It is the geometry of calisthenics, eurhythmics, 
and gymnastics. These involve the physical attributes (together with facial 
stereotypy) which find expression in acrobatic precision and in the mass 
calisthenics of the stadium, although there is no conscious awareness of 
spatial relationships here. (See first sketch next page.)
