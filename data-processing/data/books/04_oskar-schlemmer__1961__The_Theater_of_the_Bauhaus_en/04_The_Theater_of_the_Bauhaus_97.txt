we can begin to appreciate the many possibilities for the imaginative use of 
color play. 
We shall dress one . . . two . . . three actors in stylized padded tights and 
papier-m%ch6 masks. The effect of the tights and masks together is to re- 
group the various and diffuse parts of the human body into a simple, unified 
form. The three actors will be dressed in the primary colors: red, yellow, 
blue. If we now assign to each of these actors a different way of walking - 
a slow, a normal, and a tripping gait - and if we let them measure out their 
space, so to speak, in time to a kettledrum, a snare drum, and wooden 
blocks, the result will be the "space dance" (illustration 5). If we put cer- 
tain basic forms, such as a ball, a club, a wand, and a pole, into their hands, 
and if we let their gestures and movements instinctively follow what these 
shapes convey to them, the result is what we can call "form dance" (illus- 
tration 6). If we now provide the masks with mustaches and glasses, 
the hands with gloves, the torsos with stylized dinner jackets, and if we add 
to their various ways of walking also places to sit down (a swivel chair, an 
armchair, a bench) and also various kinds of sounds (murmuring and hiss- 
ing noises; double-talk and jabbering; an occasional bit of pandemonium;
