perhaps also a phonograph, piano, and trumpet), the result is what we call 
"gesture dance" (illustrations 7, 10). The intentionally grotesque 
"Musical Clown" with his bare-ribbed umbrella, glass curls, colored pom- 
pom tuft, goggle eyes, inflated nobnose, toy saxophone, accordion chest, xylo- 
phone arm, miniature fiddle, funnel-shaped leg with a drum attached, gauze 
train, and floppy shoes, is the winsome and pathetic companion to the other 
three figures in a quite seriously intended quartet (illustration 12). With 
these four actors as a nucleus, we now expand into a chorus of gray and 
ghostlike stereotype figures which, either individually or as a group, will 
demonstrate both rhythmic and dramatic patterns of motion (illustration 
4). Finally, we shall create for the players a universe of walls, props, 
and other stage equipment which can be easily transported and put up any- 
where (illustration 1 1 ). 
By confining ourselves to one particular area of that vast complex called 
the stage, to the area of pantomime and the highly disciplined chamberwork 
(Kleinkunst), 
the sense of our endeavor 
is to arrive at an art form which will at least try to compete with the
