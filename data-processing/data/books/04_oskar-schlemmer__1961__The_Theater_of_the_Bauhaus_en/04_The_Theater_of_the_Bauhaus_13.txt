This theater provides a stage in arena form, a proscenium and a back stage, the 
latter divided in three parts. The 2,000 seats are disposed in the form of an amphi- 
theater. There are no boxes. By turning the big stage platform which is solidary 
with part of the orchestra, the small proscenium stage is placed in the center of 
the theater, and the usual set can be replaced by projecting scenery on twelve 
screens placed between the twelve main columns supporting the structure.
