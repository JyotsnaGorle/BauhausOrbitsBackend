Burger and Elsa H6tzel and the master craftsman Carl Schlemmer. First performance of parts of the bollet 
in 1915. First performance of the entire ballet September, 1922, in the Stuttgart Landestheater. Ala~ 
performed in 1923 during the Bauhaus Week at the Nationaltheater, Weimar, and at the Annual Exhibition 
of German Crafts, Dresden.) 
The Triadic Ballet consists of three parts which form a structure of stylized dance scenes, 
is a gay burlesque with lemon- 
developing from the humorous to the serious. The first 
yellow drop curtains. The second, ceremonious and solemn, is on a rose-colored stage. 
And the third is a mystical fantasy on a black stage. The twelve different dances in 
eighteen different costumes are danced alternately by three persons, two male and one 
female. The costumes are partly of padded cloth and partly of stiff papier-m8ch6 forms, 
coated with metallic or colored paint.
