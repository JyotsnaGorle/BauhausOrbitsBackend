THE DEATH OF THE MONUMENT 
By Lewis Mu mford 
THE human impulse to create everlasting monuments springs perhaps out of 
the desire for the Jiving to perpetuate themselves. To achieve this in terms of 
biology only one means is possible: organic reproduction, and all the classic 
civilizations, above all the most enduring of these, that of the Chinese, have re­
garded the begetting of children as a sacred duty as well as a blessing. Renewal 
through reproduction is one means of ensuring continuity: but there is still 
another, springing not out of life but out of death: to wall out life and to ex­
clude the action of time by carving monuments in durable materials: the 
primitive burial mounds, the big stones of the Salisbury plains and of Brittany, 
the pyramids and sphinxes of Egypt, the ironic gestures of Sargon and Ozy­
mandias and the Pharaohs, of Louis XIV and Peter the Great. 
Ordinary men must be content to fix their image in their children: retro­
spectively they may seek to ensure immortality by imposing the cult of the 
ancestor. But the rich and the powerful do not have trust in the powers of 
renewal: they seek a more static immortality: they write their boasts upon 
tombstones, they incorporate their deeds as well as their astronomical lore in 
obelisks: they place their hopes of remembrance upon stone joined to stone, 
dedicated to their subjects and heirs forever: forgetful of the fact that stones 
which are deserted by life are even more helpless than life that is unprotected 
by stones. 
In general, one may say that the classic civilizations of the world, up to 
our own, have been oriented toward death and toward fixity: a Heraclitus 
might observe that all things flow, a Lucretius might see that man is a part of 
the eternally changing cycle of nature: but the aim of the civilization was per­
manence and fixity: the dead hand felt frustrated unless it could keep within 
its rigid grasp the fate of the living. Men die; the building goes on: the burial
