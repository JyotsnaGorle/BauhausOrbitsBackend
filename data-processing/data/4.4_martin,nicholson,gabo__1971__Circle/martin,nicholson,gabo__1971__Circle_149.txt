9. CHERMAYEFF, SERGE 
NEW OFFICES AT CAMDEN TOWN 1937 
This office block is placed at the corner of 
two cobbled streets which serve an adjacent 
goods yard. The problem finally resolved 
itself into one of noise elimination from two 
sources: 
1. Structure borne sound, i.e. transmission 
of vibration from roadway through 
building; 
2. air-borne sound, i.e. street noise entering 
directly through windows or being 
reflected from adjacent buildings 
through windO\vs. 
These considerations have governed the 
entire design and have been dealt with as 
follows: 
1. Elimination of structure borne sound. 
The reinforced concrete structure stands 
on a cork bed (A) and is insulated in­
ternally with Heraklith slab (B). The 
foundations are in addition isolated by 
an air duct by means of an anti-v-ibra­
tion waJI (C) on the street side of the 
building. This vibration wall and the 
intermediary floor slabs are themselves 
isolated one from another by expansion 
joints filled either with bitumen or cork.
