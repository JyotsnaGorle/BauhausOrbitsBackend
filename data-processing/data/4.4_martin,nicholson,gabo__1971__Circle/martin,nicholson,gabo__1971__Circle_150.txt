low tile and slag concrete screed, i.e. 
cellular, sound insulating with cork 
floors for noise elimination at source. 
2. Elimination of air borne sound. The 
whole building has been sealed and is air 
conditioned from a plenum plant in the ; 
: 
basement. Windows open with coach 
keys for cleaning purposes only: win­
dows are double glazed with two differ­
6 5

ent thicknesses of glass of different 
vibration periods; teak frames are used 
to make them more inert, sound resisting

and rattleproof. Window areas have 7 
i 
been reduced as far as possible without 
light loss. All ceilings in offices facing 
91 
the street are in addition acoustically 
I 
treated with absorbent acoustic plaster 
to prevent noise reflection. 
Board rooms are on the sixth floor. The 
Canteen where silence is not an essen­
I 
tial factor, has been placed on the 
I J 4

ground floor where the various preven­
I 
tative measures are in any case likely to 
be less effective.
