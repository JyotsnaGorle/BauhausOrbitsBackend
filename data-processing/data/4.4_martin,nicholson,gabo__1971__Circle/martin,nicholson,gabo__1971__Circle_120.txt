CONSTRUCTION IN SPACE 
in the impetuous verticals of the Gothic sculpture the image of the Christian idea? 
Sculpture personifies and inspires the ideas of all great epochs. It mani足
fests the spiritual rhythm and directs it. All these faculties \vere lost in the de足
dining period of our culture of the last century. The Constructive idea has 
given back to sculpture its old forces and faculties, the most powerful of which 
is its capacity to act architectonically. This capacity was what enabled sculp足
ture to keep pace with architecture and to guide it. In the new architecture of 
today we again see an evidence of this influence. This proves that the construc足
tive sculpture has started a sound growth, because architecture is the queen of 
all the arts, architecture is the axis and the embodiment of human culture. By 
architecture I mean not only the building of houses but the whole edifice of 
our everyday existence. 
Those who try to retard the growth of the constructive sculpture are making 
a mistake when they say that constructive sculpture is not sculpture at all. 
On the contrary, it is the old glorious and powerful art re-born in its absolute 
form ready to lead us into the future.
