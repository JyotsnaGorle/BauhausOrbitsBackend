Tea-table made of a single piece of bent plywood. H ere the plywood is not 
used merely as a panel or as a plane surface borne by separate structural mem­
bers; it performs two functions at one and the same time-it bears weight and 
forms its own planes. H ere we have a new material and a new form which has 
resemblance to the tubular steel furniture shapes from which it was 
very little 
derived. H ere, the usual joinery construction gives place to the new 
originally 
bending technique.

The characteristic quality of plywood is that it removes the possibility of 
warping and breaking, which in ordinary wood depends so much on the direc­

stable. Each side of this chair is cut out of a single piece of plywood and joined 
by the thin bent seat and back.
