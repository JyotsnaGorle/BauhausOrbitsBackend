EDITORIAL 
A NEW cultural unity is slowly emerging out of the fundamental changes which 
are taking place in our present-day civilization; but it is unfortunately true 
that each new evidence of creative activity arouses a special opposition, and 
this is particularly evident in the field of art. The inaccessibility of certain 
branches of science at least relieves the scientist from outside interference: the 
obvious utility of other advances gives the technician more or less freedom- it 
is not, of course, difficult to recall several far-reaching innovations which the 
public has shown itself willing to accept. But the creative work of the artist, 
for which it is difficult to claim any of the more practical virtues, is never free 
from interference in one form or another. Even a new development in archi­
tecture where it is certainly possible to show an advance in efficiency and 
economy of means, will not necessarily find itself applauded when it becomes 
clear that architecture, in changing its means, must also change its formal 
appearance. 
It is indeed fair to say, that popular taste, caste prejudice, and the depend­
ence upon private enterprise, completely handicap the development of new 
ideas in art. But, in spite of this, the ideas represel!ted by the work in this book 
have grown spontaneously in most countries of the world. The fact that they 
have, in the course of the last twenty years, become more crystallized, precise, 
and more and more allied to the various domains of social life, indicates their 
organic growth in the mind of society and must prove that these creative acti­
vities cannot be considered as the temporary mood of an artistic sect, but are, 
on the contrary, an essential part of the cultural development of our time. 
In starting this publication we have a dual purpose; firstly, to bring this 
work before the public, and secondly, to give to artists-painters, sculptors, 
architects and writers-the means of expressing their views and of maintaining 
contact with each other. Our aim is to gather here those forces which seem to 
us to be working in the same direction and for the same ideas, but which are,
