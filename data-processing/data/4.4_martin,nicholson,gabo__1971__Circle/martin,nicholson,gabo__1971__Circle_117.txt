ception of ~lasses, emphasizing it and forming it, \\ c cn1 ich the expression of 
~lass making it more essential through the contr.lst between them ''hereby 
?-.lass retains its solidity and Space its extension. 
Closely related to the space problem in sculpture is the problem of Time. 
There is an affinity between them although the satisfactory solution of the 
latter still remains unsol\'ed, being complex and obstructed by many obstacles. 
The definite solution is still handicapped by its technical difliculties. X e\ cr­
theless, the idea and the way for its solution is already traced in its main outlines 
by the constructi,-e art. I find it essential for the completion of the discussion 
' 
of the whole problem of our sculpture to sketch here in general terms the 
question of Time. 
~Iy first definition, formulated in the Realistic .\Janifesto, was: '\\"e deny the 
thousand-year-old Egyptian prejudice that static rhythms are the only possible 
bases for a sculpture. \\'e proclaim the kinetic rhythms as a ne\\· and essential 
part of our sculptural work, because they are the only possible real expressions 
of Time emotions.' It follows from this definition that the problem of Time in 
sculpture is synonymous with the problem of motion. I t would not be difficult 
to prove that the proclamation of this ne\..,- element is not the product of the 
idle fancy of an efficient mind. The constructive artists are not the first and\\ ilL 
I hope, not be the last, to exert themselves in the effort to solve this problem. 
\\' e can find traces of these efforts in almost too many e.xamples of ancient 
sculpture. It was only presented in illusory forms which made it difficult for the 
observer to recognize it. For instance, who has not admired in the \ 'icrory of 
Samothrace, the so-called dynamic rhythms, the imaginary forward movement 
incorporated in this sculpture? The expression of motion is the main purpose 
of the composition of the lines and masses of this work. But in this sculpture the 
feeling of motion is an illusion and exists only in our minds. The real Time does 
not par6cipate in this emotion; in fact, it is timeless. To bring Time as a reality 
into our consciousness, to make it active and perceivable \,·e need the rea] 
moYement of substantial masses removable in space. 
The existence of the arts of 11usic and Choreography proves that the
