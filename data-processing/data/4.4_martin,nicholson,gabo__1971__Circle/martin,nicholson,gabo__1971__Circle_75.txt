artist to have a knowledge of these sciences (nor is it necessary for the surrealist 
to have a knowledge of psycho-analysis); such concepts are part of our mental 
ambience, and the artist is precisely the individual who can make this ambience 
actual. He can make it actual in detached and non-utilitarian works of art; or 
he can make it actual in architecture and the industrial arts. In either case he 
is serving the highest interests of humanity, which is never to halt in a static 
deadlock, never to revert to an easier path, never to acknowledge defeat when 
confronted with a contradiction; but ever to negate the negation, to proceed 
to fresh syntheses, to new paths, to whatever new awareness his evolving con­
sciousness shall lead.
