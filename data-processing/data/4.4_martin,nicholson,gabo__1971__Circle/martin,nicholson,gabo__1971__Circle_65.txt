PLASTIC ART AND PURE PLASTIC A RT 
If all real art is ' the sum total of emot ions aroused by plu ely pit.tori.d 
means' his art is the sum of the emotions aroused by plastic means. 
It would be illogical to suppose that non-flgurative arl vvill remain sta­
tionary, for this art contains a culture of the use of new plastic means and their 
determinate relations. Because the field is new there is a ll th e more lo be done. 
vVhat is certain is that no escape is possible for th e non-figurative artist; he 
must stay within his field and march towards the consequence of his art. 
This consequence brings us, in a future perhaps remote, towards the end 
of art as a thing separated from our surrounding environment, 'll'lzich is the actual p!asllc 
reality. But this end is at the same time a new beginning . Art will not only con­
tinue but will realize itself more and more. By the unification of architecture, 
sculpture and painting, a new plastic reality will be created. Painting and sculp­
ture will not manifest themselves as separate objects, n or as ' mural art' which 
destroys architecture itself, nor as 'applied' art, but bein,g purelv constructive will 
aid the creation of an atmosphere not merely utilitarian or rational but also 
ure and complete in its beauty.
