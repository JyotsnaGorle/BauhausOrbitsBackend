ROUTES OF HOUSING ADVANCE 
By Richard J. Neutra 
H ousiNG of the unsheltered would be a comparatively easy task. It is rehousing 
of the traditionally conditioned, the reconditioning of populations as to dwell­
ing habits which unrolls all the psychological complications of this socio-

Rehousing of populations can take place in various ways, of which com­
prehensively planned effort is only one. I t certainly has not been the way fol­
lowed in U.S.A. before the last half-decade of depressed activity. \\'hether or

in the process by developing an effective consciOusness and a selective accept­

give, or fail to give, wholesome character to an entire period. 
First: Rehousing can happen without any specific consciousness as an inert 
reiteration of past habitational conditions by piecemeal replacement of depre­

lescence periods by the pace of present technological development and its 
variegated social and economic consequences, that obstructs such peaceful 
stagnation and complicates it with sectional booms and drops in property 
values. Population shifts follow and evacuations of quarters, now doomed to 
sink into the cast reservoir of blighted areas, over which there is as yet no cen­

Second: Rehousing emerges and appears as an ideal goal to consumers' 
groups who first may have organized themselves for minor purposes. In U.S.A. 
such co-operative programmes have been proclaimed, for example, within 
the numerous so-called 'Co-operatives of Unemployed' to whom the writer 
gave professional assistance for years. Groups with greater financial substance
