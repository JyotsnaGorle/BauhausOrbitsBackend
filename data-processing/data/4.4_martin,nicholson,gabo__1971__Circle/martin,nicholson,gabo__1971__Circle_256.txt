LIGHT PAINTING 
of visual life today. The theatre, the colour film, advertising in light, etc., pro ­
duce colour combinations which very often seem to be con trary to all previous 
principles of colour, because the light machines, reflectors and lamps produce 
purely physical complementary contrasts which have never hitherto been em­
ployed since they show automatic effects of light which have not been passed 
through the medium of the human eye. 
The great problem put before our generation is to find the balance be­
tween our psycho-physical limitations and the uncontrolled achievements 
which proceed without any ordered limits from the machine which we our­
selves have created. 
I t seems to me that the artistic and scientific work of the twentieth century 
shows an instinctive beginning in this direction and that every step farther and 
every partial problem solved is of vital importance to the whole further deve­
lopment. An Academy of Light which would raise the intuitive proceedings to 
the level of consciousness and make practical and pedagogic use of them 
\vould be the first and most important step towards systematic co-operation 
between the scattered forces of art and technics.
