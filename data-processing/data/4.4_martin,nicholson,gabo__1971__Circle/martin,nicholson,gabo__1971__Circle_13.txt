THE CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA IN ART

The borderline\\ hich separated the e\.tcrnal ''oriel from the artist and clistill­
guishccl it in forms ofobjeets disappeared; the objects themsd\l'S disintegratl·d 
into their component parts and a picture ceased to be an im.1ge of the \'isihlc 
of an object ac; a unit, a world in itself, but appeared as ,1 mere piclllral 
forms 
analvsis of the inner mechanism or its cells. The medium bet\\'ecnthc inm·r" orld

of the artist and the external \\'oriel has lost its extension, and bet'' ecn the inner 
world of the perceptions of the artist and the outer "oriel of existing things 
there was no longer any substantial medium left "hich could be measured 
either by distance or by mind. The contours of the external \\·oriel which served 
before as the only guides to an orientation in it were erased; even the necessity 
orientation lost its importance and was replaced by other problems, those of 
for 
exploration and analysis. The creati\'e act of the Cubists \\as entirely at \'ari­
ance with any which we ha\·e obser\'ed before. Instead of takinfS the object as 
a separate \vorld and passing it through his perceptions producing a third ob­
ject, namely the picture, which is the product of the first two, the Cubist trans­
fers the entire inner vvorld of his perceptions with all its component parts lof?;iC, 
emotion and will ) into the interior of the object penetrating through its ,,·hole 
structure, stretching its substance to such an extent that the outside integu­
ment explodes and the object itself appears destroyed and unrecognizable. 
That is why a Cubistic painting seems like a heap of shards from a vessel ex­
ploded from within. The Cubist has no special interest in those forms which 
differentiate one object from another. 
Although the Cubists still regarded the external 'Norld as the point of de­
parture for their Art they did not see and did not ·want to see any difference 
between, say, a violin, a tree, a human body, etc. All those objects \\·ere for 
them only one extended matter with a unique structure and only this structure 
was of importance for their analytic task. It is understandable that in such an 
artistic concept of the world the details must possess unexpected dimensions 
and the parts acquire the value of entities, and in the inner relations between 
them the disproportion grows to such an extent that all inherited ideas about 
harmony are destroyed. V\'hen we look through a Cubistic painting to its con­
cept of the world the same thing happens to us as when we enter the interior of 
a building which we know only from a distance-it is surprising, unrecognizable 
and strange. The same thing happens \vhich occurred in the world of physics 
when the new Relativity Theory destroyed the borderlines between .;\latter and
