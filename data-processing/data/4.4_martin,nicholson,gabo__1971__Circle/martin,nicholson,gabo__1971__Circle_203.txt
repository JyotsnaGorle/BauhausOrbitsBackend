ARCHITECTU RE AND MATERIAL 
only imperfectly. For exa n1ple, a bakelite table top is less sensitive (more hard­
wearing), easier to clean and pleasantcr in usc than the other materials hitherto 
known. 
These new materials are chromium, the diflc ren t aluminium allo) s, arti­
ficial silk, rubber, oil products, reinforced concrete, glasswool, asbestos, etc. 
2 . Older and more generally known materials can have their most im­
portant characteristics altered by new \vork processes and methods of con­
struction. They are thereby also cheapened and made more generally acces­
sible. Plywood for example is something quite different from wood. Glass, steel 
and cork, well known for a long time, exhibit today different characteristics and 
offer new and wider perspectives. 
3· The modern movement in architecture utilizes these new materials. I t 
tries to discover their laws without any aesthetic or technical prejudice. It en­
deavours to find the language of their form. A new aesthetic develops in which 
the new materials are given their new place. 
4· The basis of modern architecture, however, is not the new materials, 
nor even the new form, but the new mentality; that is to say, the view we take 
and the manner in which we judge our needs. Thus modern architecture 
would exist even without reinforced concrete, plywood and linoleum. I t would 
exist even in stone, wood and brick. It is important especially to emphasize this 
because the doctrinaire and unselective use of the new materials is not only 
harmful to the prestige of the modern movement, but falsifies also the basic 
principles of our work. We are particularly interested in the new materials, not 
because of any so-called desire for style, but we investigate, foster and utilize 
them only if we can thereby achieve a genuine improvement, a greater degree 
of clarity, a greater ease, and a truer exposition of living as a whole, including 
aesthetics.
