THE WORK OF THE C.I.A.M. 
(Congres lnternationaux d, Architecture Moderne) 
By Siegfried Giedion 
As one who is in close contact with the daily work of the Congresses and \·..-110 
has helped to organize them from their inception, I regard it as particularly 
important to inform the public about the details of this work and about the 
benefits which each contributor derives from contact with it. 
The character of this work is quite simple: our road was marked out by

The procedure is as follows: the subject is decided, and all the national
