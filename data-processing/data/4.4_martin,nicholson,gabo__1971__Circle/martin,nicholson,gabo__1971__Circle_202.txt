ARCH ITECTURE AND MATERIAL 
By Marcel Breuer 
'NEw materials, new possibilities, new constructions, new forms: these are the 
bases of a modern art of building.' What is there in this thesis? How far is it 
true? This is what we propose to examine briefly in the follm·ving notes. 
The ordinary man, even if he builds and paints and is a home-made philo­
sopher, will soon meet the perennial question: what was first, the hen or the 
egg? Which is the primary, a change in the sense of form, which creates for its 
realization its own materials, or the technical and economic evolution which 
blindly, so to speak, creates new products, whether or no these may lead to new 
forms. 
I am not in a position to produce any order in my thoughts on this parti­
cular question. In spite of the prevailing fashion, I am not in a position to 
specialize the mind. I do not believe that a decided attitude on this point is at 
all necessary. We need not decide between the visionary and anticipatory sen­
sitiveness of the artist-inventor and the massive force of the systematic tech­
nician. The mind does not travel on rails, nor is it mechanically guided. It 
chooses the method which will most effectively advance it: in jumps, or step by 
step, by trial and error, or by logical precision. What is already there is ad­
apted: what is lacking is created anew. 
I would therefore regard it as a matter of indifference whether modern 
architecture is called upon to fu lfil the spirit of the new materials, or whether 
the new material (an inanimate thing in itself) should only serve the will of the 
new architecture (a new aesthetic?). 
To give a rough idea of what I have in mind, the following facts about our 
activities may be mentioned : 
I. A large number of new materials serve practical purposes in a manner 
which it has not hitherto been possible to achieve at all, or at least, to achieve
