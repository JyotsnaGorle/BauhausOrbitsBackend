PEDAGOGICAL SKETCHBOOK
BY PAUL KLEE
INTRODUCTION AND TRANSLATION BY SIBYL MOHOLY-NAGY
87 illustrations
Paul Klee occupies a unique position among the creators of
modern art. Although he shed all ties with conventional
presentation, he developed a closer and deeper relationship
to reality than did most painters of his time. Without any
attempt at imitation or idealization, he recorded proportion,
motion, and depth in space as the fundamental attributes of
the visual world.
Klee collected his observations in his PEDAGOGICAL SKETCH
BOOK, intended as the basis for the course in design theory
at the famous Bauhaus art school in Germany. From the
simple phenomenon of interweaving lines, his work leads to
the comprehension of defined planes-of structure, dimen
sion, equilibrium, and motion. But he employs no abstract
formulas. The student remains in the familiar world-a
world that acquires new significance through the straight
forward approach of Klee's simple, lucid drawings and his
precise captions. Chessboard, bone, muscle, heart, a water
wheel, a plant, railroad ties, a tightrope walker-these serve
as examples for the forty-three design lessons.
PEDAGOGICAL SKETCHBOOK is a vital contribution toward
a more human, more universal goal in design education
the work of a visionary painter who dedicated himself to the
practical task of making people see.
"A key to understanding of the art of Paul Klee, one which
can be used most profitably by the art student."-College Art
Journal.
This new translation was prepared by the late SIBYL MOHOLY-NAGY, who
followed Klee's text with the utmost fidelity.
