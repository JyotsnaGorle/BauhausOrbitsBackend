Fig. 18: Both dimensions combined, seen diagonally.
In contrast to structural units, individual (or abstract) numerical divisions
cannot be reduced to I, but must stop at proportions
such as 2:3:5
or 7:11:13:17
or a:b =b: (a+b) (Golden. Section).
Since these figure arrangements rest on the principle of repetition, any
number of parts can be added or taken away without changing their
rhythmic character.
Therefore the structural
character is divisional.
