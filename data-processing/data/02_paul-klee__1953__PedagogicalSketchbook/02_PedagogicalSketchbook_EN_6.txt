been transformed by the counter forces of earth and world, of mechani
cal law and imaginative vision, and it has found equilibrium in a cen
trality that no longer points away but rests within a unified diversity
(1111.43). The sum total is what Paul Klee calls "Resonanzverh√§ltnis,"
meaning a reverberation of the finite in the infinite, of outer perception
and inner vista. The experience of this dual reality of the SEEN and the
FELT essence of nature, impels the student toward
"a free creation of abstracted forms which supersede di
dactic principles with a new naturalness, the naturalness
of the work. He produces or participates in the produc
tion of works which are indications of the work of God."
