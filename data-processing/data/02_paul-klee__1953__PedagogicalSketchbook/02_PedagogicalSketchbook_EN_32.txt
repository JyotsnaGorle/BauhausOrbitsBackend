experience, or the path of an eclipse, the swing on its rope hooks-free
and confined at the same time, the forward dash of sail and prow.
These are mere hints, pointing toward a use of Klee's book that will, in

... give sense to the vulgar,
give mysteriousness to the common,
give the dignity of the unknown to the obvious,
and a trace of infinity to the temporal."
