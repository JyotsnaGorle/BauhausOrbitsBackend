(arrow) may be eliminated.
The given white, much-too-much-seen and tiresome white, is noticed by
the eye with little sensation; but the contrasting peculiarity of sudden
action (black) sharpens the vividness of vision toward the climax or the
termination of this action.
This extraordinary increase in energy (in a productive sense) or of
energy food (in a receptive sense) is decisive for the direction of
movement.
