Research
The ideal of all research is:
1. precise investigation of each individual phenomenon—in isolation,
2. the reciprocal effect of phenomena upon each other—in combinations,
3. general conclusions which are to be drawn from the above two divisions.

The investigation should proceed in a exact and pedantically

the smallest alteration in the nature, in the characteristics, in the effects
of the individual elements should escape the watchful eye. Only by means
of a microscopic analysis can the science of art lead to a comprehensive
synthesis, which will extend far beyond the confines of art into the realm
of the "oneness" of the "human" and the "divine."
This, after all, is the perceptible goal, though it nevertheless lies far in the
future.

Book
The aim of this small book is merely to point out, in a general and funda-
mental way, the "graphic" basic elements viewed:
1. "abstractly," i.e. isolated from the objective environment of the ma-
terial form of the material plane, and
2. on the material plane—the effect of the fundamental characteristics
of this plane.
But even this must be restricted to a rather superficial investigation
—as
an attempt to find a standard method in this scientific
research of art
and to test it in its use.
