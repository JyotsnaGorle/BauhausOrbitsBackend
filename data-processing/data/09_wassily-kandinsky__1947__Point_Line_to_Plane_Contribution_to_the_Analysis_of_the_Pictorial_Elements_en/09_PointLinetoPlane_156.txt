If this deep-going relationship actually exists, we have a certain confirma-
tion of our surmise that phenomena which seem to be fundamentally differ-
ent on the surface and completely separate from each other derive from
one single root. Today, especially, the necessity of finding this common root
appears inevitable to us. Such necessities do not arise without an inner
motivation, but many determined attempts are required in order finally to
satisfy them. These necessities are of an intuitive nature. The road to ful-
fillment is also chosen intuitively. The rest is a harmonious combination of
intuition and calculationâ€”in the long run neither the one nor the other
alone suffices.

The BP is material: it is created in a purely material way and is dependent Texture
