My definition of the concept "composition" Is as follows: Concept

position
A composition is the inwardly-purposeful subordination
1. of the Individual elements and
2. of the build-up (construction)
toward the goal of concrete pictoriality.

position
Basis
When the differences in compositions are considered externally, the pic-
torial aims, exclusively, are to be equated with the numerical differences.
These are quantitative differences, while it goes without saying that in
the case of the "prototype of pictorial expression," the qualitative ele-
ment is completely lacking. When the work of art is estimated on a
decidedly qualitative basis, a double sound at least is necessary to the
composition. This is one of the cases which clearly emphasizes the differ-
ence between external and inner measures and means. We find upon
closer examination that altogether pure double sounds never really occur;
this statement must remain an assertion only, to be proven later. At all
events, a composition can be created on a qualitative basis only through
the use of multiple sounds.
At the moment the point is moved from the center of the basic plane
Eccentric
Structure
eccentric structure—the double sound becomes audible:
1. absolute sound of the point,
2. sound of the given location in the basic plane.
This second sound, which in the case of the centric structure
was almost
silenced, again becomes distinct and transforms
the sound of the point
from the absolute to the relative.

Bound op with this question is a special "modern" question "Can a work be created
by purely mechanical means?" In cases of the most primitive numerical problems,
this
must be answered in the affirmative.
