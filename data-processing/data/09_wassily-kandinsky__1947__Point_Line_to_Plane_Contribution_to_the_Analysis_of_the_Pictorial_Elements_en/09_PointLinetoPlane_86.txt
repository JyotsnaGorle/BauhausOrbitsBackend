The from the straight line consists in the number and kind
of tensions:
the straight line has two distinct primitive tensions which play
an unimportant role in the case of the curved line, whose chief tension
resides in the arc (third tension, which opposes and out-sounds the others)
(Fig. 34). While the piercing quality of the angle disappears, there is still
greater force confined here which, even though it is less aggressive, has
greater endurance concealed within it. Something thoughtlessly youthful
exists in the angle while in the arc is a mature energy, rightfully self-con-

This maturity and the elastic full sound of the curved line lead us to seek
