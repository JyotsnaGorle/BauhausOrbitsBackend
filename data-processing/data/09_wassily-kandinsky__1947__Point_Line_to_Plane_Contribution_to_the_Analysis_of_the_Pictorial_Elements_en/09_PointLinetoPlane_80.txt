sharp, active angles—and become the sign-post to yellow. Thus, the
acute angle has a yellow colour within.
The obtuse angle increasingly loses its aggression, its piercing quality, its
warmth, and is, thereby, distantly related to a line without angles which,
as will be shown below, constitutes the third primary, typical form of the
plane—the circle. The passiveness in the obtuse angle, the almost missing
forward tension, gives this angle a light blue tone.
In addition, further relationships can be indicated: the acuter the angle,
the closer it approaches sharp warmth and vice versa, the warmth de-
toward the red right angle and inclines and
creases more more to cold-
until the obtuse angle develops; this typical
ness, (150°) is a blue angle
presentiment curved line which, further
and is a of the in its course, has
circle
the as its final goal.
