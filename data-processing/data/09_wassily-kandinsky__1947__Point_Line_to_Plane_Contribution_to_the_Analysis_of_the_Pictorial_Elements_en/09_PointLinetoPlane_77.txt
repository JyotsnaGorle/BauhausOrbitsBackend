direction. There can be only 4 right angles which touch each other—they
either touch with their points and form a cross or, by the touching of their
diverging sides, they form right-angle planes—in most instances creating
the square.
The horizontal-vertical cross consists of one warm and one cold line—it is
nothing other than the central position of the horizontal and vertical. This
accounts for the cold-warm or warm-cold temperature of the right angle,
depending upon its direction. Details concerning this will be given in the
section entitled "Basic Plane."
