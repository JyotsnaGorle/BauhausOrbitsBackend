upon as such and so used. In other words, texture must not become an end
in itself; it must serve the idea residing in the composition (purpose), just
every other element (means). Otherwise, an inner disharmony arises

in which the means drown out the end. The external has taken over the
inner—mannerism.
In this case may be seen one of the differences between "objective" and

For the abstract, a certain technique can, of course, serve a definite pur-

technical necessity as, for example, in zincography, where the division of the surface

to play an
independent role and, to the extent that the technique permits this, it is deliberately
repressed.
