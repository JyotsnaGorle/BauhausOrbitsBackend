is a means to the attainment of elementary harmony in every
form of art. Aside from this, we have to deal here with two double sounds:
every part of the basic plane has a sound peculiar to itself and an indi-
vidual inner colouration. As a result, facts of apparently little importance
produce consequences of unexpected complexity.

Since, moreover, the point is a complex unit (its size plus its shape), it is
easy to imagine what a storm of sounds can develop from a continuing
accumulation of points on the basic plane—even when these points are
identical; and how this turmoil develops and spreads out, while its further
disparity
course points to the ever-growing in the size and form of the
points which are projected upon the plane.
Also, in nature's unmixed realm, this accumulation of points occurs
