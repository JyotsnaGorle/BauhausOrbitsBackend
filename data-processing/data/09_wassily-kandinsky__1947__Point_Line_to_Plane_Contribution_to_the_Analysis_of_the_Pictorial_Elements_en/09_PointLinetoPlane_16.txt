FOREWORD
It is perhaps not without interest to remark that the thoughts developed in
this small book are an organic continuation of my book, "On the Spiritual
direction,
in Art." Since I have set out in this I must continue in it.
At the beginning of the World War, I spent three months in Goldach on
Lake Constance and employed this time almost exclusively in systematizing
both my theoretic ideas, which sometimes had been imprecise, and my
practical experience. In this way, a rather large fund of theoretic material
was assembled.
This material remained untouched for almost ten years. Not until quite
recently has it become possible for me to develop it further. So, this book
came into existence.
purposely condensed the questions which I have posed concerning
I have
beginning Science of Art, but these questions—when developed
the of the
beyond the boundaries of painting, and finally of art
consistently pass
—
only to point the way, to establish certain ana-
altogether. Here I seek
time, to take synthetic values into
lytical methods and, at the same
account.
