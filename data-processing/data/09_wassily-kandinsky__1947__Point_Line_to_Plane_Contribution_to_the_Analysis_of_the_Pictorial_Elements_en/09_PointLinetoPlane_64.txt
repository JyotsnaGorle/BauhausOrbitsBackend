The geometric line is an invisible thing. It is the track made by the moving
point; that is, its product. It is created by movement—specifically through
the destruction of the intense self-contained repose of the point. Here,
the leap out of the static into the dynamic occurs.
The line is, therefore, the greatest antithesis to the pictorial proto-
element—the point. Viewed in the strictest sense, it can be designated as
a secondary element.
The forces coming from without which transform the point into a line, can Origin
be very diverse. The variation in lines depends upon the number of these
forces and upon their combinations.
In the final analysis, line forms can be reduced to two cases:
all
1. application of
one force and
2. application
of two forces:
a) single alternate action forces,
or repeated, of both
b)
simultaneous action of both forces.

tion, the first type of line results; the initial direction remains unchanged
and the line has the tendency to run in a straight course to infinity.
This is the straight line whose tension represents the most concise
form of the potentiality for endless movement.
For the concept "movement," which used almost everywhere, I have

substituted the term "tension." customary
The term is inexact and thereby
leads us down
the wrong roads and is the cause of further terminological
misconceptions.
"Tension" is the force living within the element and
represents only
one part of the creative "movement." The second part 57
