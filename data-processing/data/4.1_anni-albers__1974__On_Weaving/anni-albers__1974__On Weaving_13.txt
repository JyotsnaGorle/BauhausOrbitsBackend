Introductory Nate 
PnwAP'i I ~hou ld start ou t hy s<~ying that this bonk i~ not a guide (or wcavcn; 
or would-be weavers, nor is it a summary uf textile achievement, pa~t or· pres· 
ent. It i~ incomplete in that it does not take up many of the facelS whith to­
gether constitute the enormous field that is weaving. A vast literature has 
accumulated on this subject, each contribution taking u p some of its many 
aspects. I approached the subj ect as one concerned with the visu:1l, stnlcturll l 
side of weav ing rather than that dealing with the problem u( warmth, for in­
~tance, or such new attribmes, developed by chem istry, as being water repel· 
lent, creasc- t·csistant, Aame-reL<~rcling, etc., that are invisible. 
My concern here was to comment on some textile principles underlying 
som e;: evident facts. By taking up textile fundamcnt.1ls al1d methods, I hoped 
to include in my audience not only weavers but also those whose work in 
other fields encompasses texti le problems. 
This book, then, is an effort in that direction.
