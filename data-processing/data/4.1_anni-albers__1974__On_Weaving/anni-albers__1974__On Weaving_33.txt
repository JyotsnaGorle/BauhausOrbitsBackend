The d raw-loom operates single warp threads mechan ically, and in this 
re~pc:ct it has reached the end of possible development. However. it operates 
si ngle warp threads within a limited range and therefore resorts to repeats 
across the width of the fabric This, in combinntion with the great fineness of 
threads and the g-reat number that now were man agei!ble, led to the art of
