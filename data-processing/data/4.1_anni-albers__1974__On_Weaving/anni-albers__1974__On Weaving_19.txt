CHAPTER ONE 
Weaving, Hand 
ON1' of the most ancient crafts, hand weaving is" method o[ forming a pliable 
plane of threads by interlacing them rectangularly. Invented in a preceramic 
age, it has remained essentially unchanged to this day. Even the final rnechani足
union of the craft through introduction of power machinery has not changed 
the basic principle of weaving. 
Other techniques had been devised to the same end: single element tech足
niques- looping, netting, knitting, cwcheting- and multiple element tech足
niques- knotting. mili ng, twining. braiding. In weaving, in the Iau er group, 
one ~ystem of threads, the warp, crosses another one, the weft, at right angles 
and the manner of intersecting forms the different weaves. 
Grad ually the various phases of manipulating warp and weft were 
med1anized until the technique of weaving surpas~ed all others in efliciency. 
Whereas single-thread methods can be handled with few tools, weaving 
needs more complicated equipmem since the warp has to be given tension. 
The device giving such tension is the loom. Weaving, then. i~ the process of 
passing the weft between taut, alternately raised warps, as .in the basic plain 
weave, or between o ther combina1ions of selc<.:Led warps, and pressing it into 
place. 
Earl iest weaving was done on the warp-weigh t loom, where warps were 
suspended from an upper bar and weighted at bottom. Weaving here pro足
gressed downward, unlike other weaving. 1t was used in ancient Greece and. 
more recemly, by Indians of the North Pacific American coast. Next carne the 
two-bar loom, with warp strctcl1ed from bar to bar, or, for extended length, 
wound onto the bars. Used either vertically or horizomally. the warp was held
