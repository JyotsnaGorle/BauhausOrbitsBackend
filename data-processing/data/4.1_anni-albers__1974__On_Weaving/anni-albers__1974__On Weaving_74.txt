whether to dwo~c checks or \ll ipe,, elaborate patterns or a uniform surface. 
/\n extemion into the field of pictoria I i nvcn 1 ion is ru led out here because o f 
the supporting iutd not independen t c h<mtctcr rhe fabric is to have. 
To go into further d e;:tail : what in particular are the proposals that have 
come to us from the ohject-w-hc si nce its inception? It has circumscribed the 
range of the raw material tha t mighr be suitable. \ \fool, for instance, will 
to be excluded as neither dust-repellent nor mothproof without special 
have 
chemica l trea tment, while any fiber with a somewhat coated ~ur(ace, such as 
linen or rallla or a strawl ike synthetic fiber, might fit the requirements. Such 
a raw material also would have a certain stifl'ness and bulk that would pre­
vent sagging and would help the fabric keep iL~ shape. However, without ad­
ditional proces~ing it would uot be flame-r-etard ing, sh ould that be required, 
as it sometimes is in public buildings. As w weave construttion: all specifi­
cations point to a plain weave. the simplest construction existent, which 
makes a somewhat stiff materi;~l, in contrast to a satin or a twill weave, which 
would result in a more pliable fabric not dcsir·cd here. T he plai n weave als0 
prod uces, in a ba lanced relationship of warp and weft, a rnorc or less porous 
n~tneria l spccifirn lly suited to t<tkc care of the nail-hoJe problem. In addition, 
its use is a safeguard against the fabric's sagging or stretching out of shape, 
aided in this by the su1?;gested raw materia ls, which also are inelastic in charac­
ter. It also is <~n et:onomical weave using less yarn than most others, a consid­
enaion that is often vi tal. 
Continuing in our attitude of attentive passiveness, we will also be 
guided in our choice of color. though here only in part. For our response to 
color is spontaneous, passionate, and persona l, and only in some respects 
~u bjet:t to re;:ason ing. W e may choose a color hue- that is, its character as red 
or blue, for instant:e- quite autocratically. However, in regard to color value 
- that is. its degree of lightue'~ or darknes~- and also in regard to color in­
tensity- that is, its vividness- we can be led by considerations other than 
exclusively by our feeling. /\san example: our museum walls wi ll demand
