The laws of the surrounding cubical 
space. Here the cubical forms are 
transferred to the human shape: 
head, torso, arms, legs are trans- 
formed into spatial-cubical con- 
structions. 
Result : ambulant architecture. 
The functional laws of the human 
body in their relationship to space. 
These laws bring about a typifica- 
tion of the bodily forms: the egg 
shape of the head, the vase shape of 
the torso, the club shape of the arms 
and legs, the ball shape of the joints. 
Result : the marionette.
