Each of these stage forms has its corresponding representative, thus : 
the author (as writer or composer) who is the creator of the word or 
musical sound; 
the actor whose body and its movements make him the player; 
the designer who is the builder of form and color. 
Each of these stage forms can exist for itself and be complete within itself. 
The combination of two or all three stage forms - with one of them al- 
ways predominating - is a question of weight distribution, and is something 
that can be perfected with mathematical precision. The executor of this 
process is the universal regisseur or director. E.g. : 
PLAY OR PLASTIC STAGE 
ORAL STAGE 
From the standpoint of material the actor has the advantages of imme- 
diacy and independence. He constitutes his own material with his body, his 
voice, his gestures, and his movements. Today, however, the once noble type 
who was both the poet and the projector of his own word has become an 
ideal. At one time Shakespeare, who was an actor before he was a poet, filled 
this role - so, too, did the improvising actors of the cornmedia dell' arte. To- 
day's actor bases his existence as player on the writer's word. Yet when the 
word is silent, when the body alone is articulate and its play is on exhibition 
- as a dancer's is - then it is free and is its own lawgiver. 
The material of the author is word or sou?zd. 
Except for the unusual circumstance in which he is his own actor, 
singer, or musician, he creates the representational material for transmission 
and reproduction on the stage, whether it is meant for the organic human 
voice or for artificial, abstract instruments. The higher the state of perfec- 
tion of the latter, the broader their formative potential, while the human 
voice is and remains a limited, if unique, phenomenon. Mechanical reproduc- 
tion by means of various kinds of technological equipment is now capable 
of replacing the sound of the musical instrument and the human voice or of
