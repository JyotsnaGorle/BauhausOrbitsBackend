INTRODUCTION 
During the all too few years of its existence, the Bauhaus embraced the whole 
range of visual arts: architecture, planning, painting, sculpture, industrial 
design, and stage work. The aim of the Bauhaus was to find a new and power- 
ful working correlation of all the processes of artistic creation to culminate 
finally in a new cultural equilibrium of our visual environment. This could not 
be achieved by individual withdrawal into an ivory tower. Teachers and stu- 
dents as a working community had to become vital participants of the modern 
world, seeking a new synthesis of art and modern technology. Based on the 
study of the biological facts of human perception, the phenomena of form 
and space were investigated in a spirit of unbiased curiosity, to arrive at 
objective means with which to relate individual creative effort to a common 
background. One of the fundamental maxims of the Bauhaus was the de- 
mand that the teacher's own approach was never to be imposed on the stu- 
dent; that, on the contrary, any attempt at imitation by the student was to be 
ruthlessly suppressed. The stimulation received from the teacher was only to 
help him find his own bearings.

stage work. Here Oskar Schlemmer played a unique role within the com- 
munity of the Bauhaus. When he joined the staff in 1921, he first headed 
the sculpture workshop. But step by step, out of his own initiative, he broad- 
ened the scope of this workshop and developed it into the Bauhaus stage shop, 
which became a splendid place of learning. I gave this stage shop wider and 
wider range within the Bauhaus curriculum since it attracted students from
