MAN AND ART FIGURE 
The history of the theater is the history of the transfiguration of the human 
form. It is the history of man as the actor of physical and spiritual events, 
ranging from na'ivetk to reflection, from naturalness to artifice. 
The materials involved in this transfiguration are form and color, the 
materials of the painter and sculptor. The arena for this transfiguration is 
found in the constructive fusion of space and building, the realm of the archi- 
tect. Through the manipulation of these materials the role of the artist, the 
synthesizer of these elements, is determined. 
One of the emblems of our time is abstraction. It functions, on the one hand, 
to disconnect components from an existing and persisting whole, either to 
lead them individually ad absurdum or to elevate them to their greatest 
potential. On the other hand, abstraction can result in generalization and 
summation, in the construction in bold outline of a new totality. 
A further emblem of our time is mechanization, the inexorable process 
which now lays claim to every sphere of life and art. Everything which can 
is mechanized. The result: our recognition of that which 
be mechanized 
can not be mechanized. 
And last, but not the least, among the emblems of our time are the new 
potentials of technology and invention which we can use to create altogether 
new hypotheses and which can thus engender, or at least give promise of, the 
boldest fantasies.
