THIRD CHAPTER 
THE MIXED AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 
Earlier artists too allowed the aesthetic accents to dominate some­
times to a greater, sometimes to a lesser, extent. The degree of aesthetic 
accentuation depends upon how pure the aesthetic experience is and upon 
the degree of the artist's ability (technical skill) to form these aesthetic 
accents into an aesthetic unity. 
If during the aesthetic experience the artist is deflected by other proper­
ties of the object , the aesthetic accents will become indistinct; they re­
cede into the background. In this way the artist fails to achieve a clear 
expression of the aesthetic experience. 
When this occurs, as it so often does in painting, we may describe the 
experience in pre-exact painting• ) as a mixed aesthetic experience. 
Example 4 
If a painter meets a beggar and is humanly aroused by empathy for the 
man 's pitiful condition, he may translate this experience of poverty into an 
image tied to the phenomenon of a man in rags. 
In this manner a typical picture of poverty may arise which can never­
theless have little or nothing to do with artistic formation. Little, if the 
aesthetic accents are almost non-existent in the work, nothing if the 
aesthetic accents are replaced by others, e.g., ethical, emotional or social. 
Even when the aesthetic accents are strongly present but tied to the des­
cription of the man's condition, this mixed experience gives rise to a mixed 
artistic creation which lies midway between nature, imitation and art.
