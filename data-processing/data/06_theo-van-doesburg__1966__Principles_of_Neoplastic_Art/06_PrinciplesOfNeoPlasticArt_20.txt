We may say of such a case: the aesthetic accents appear indistinct 
(Fig. 12 and 13) . 
The painter has used painterly means to tell us something about the 
man's poverty. He will be able to evoke the same response with other 
means too, e.g., with words. 
If the artist's relationship to the object of his perception is strongly or 
largely aesthetic, feelings of liking and dislike (the personal and individu­
alistically human element) will give way more fully to universal aesthetic 
accents. The painter in his work of art will lay the stronger emphasis not 
on the emotional but on the aesthetic accents•). The exclusive business 
of the process of artistic formation is to organize them into a unity. In our 
example too the painter will exaggerate the aesthetic accents in the figure 
of the beggar. 
The exaggeration can be seen from the fact that greater stress is laiq upon 
the space and colour values. The artist will expose universal cosmic re­
lationships and values (balance, position, dimension, number, etc., which 
are obscured or veiled by the accidents of the individual case) not by 
empathy for the condition of the object of his perception but mainly by 
abstracting all the chance singularities of the object. 
This is the point at which illustration (imitation) ceases; here begins 
aesthetic transformation (representation) into another reality ; a real­
ity deeper than the momentary, special, arbitrary reality, a cosmic reality. 
This is the way in which all works of art which have an effect upon the 
development of visual art have come into being. In these works the 
aesthetic accents outweigh all others. 
If the artist wishes to go further, if he wishes to accept the consequen­
ces of aesthetic formation so as to be able to express the aesthetic idea 
with exclusively aesthetic means, he will have to find a new, purely 
e) Various works by Van Gogh will serve as examples.
