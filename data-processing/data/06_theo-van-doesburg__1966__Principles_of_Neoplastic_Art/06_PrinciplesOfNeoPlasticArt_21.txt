aesthetic form for the object of this perception. If he wishes to find a new 
purely aesthetic form he will be obliged to reconstruct the object of his 
perception (Fig. 14-15). He will take the object of this perception back to its 
elementary spatial manifestation, strip away all arbitrary features, simplify 
it and re-express it in artistic relationships. 
In this way the artist himself creates the aesthetic accents by using 
appropriate means: colour planes and plastic space in painting, volume 
and three-dimensional space in sculpture, etc. 
The aesthetic accents now emerge clearly, they are free of ties and are 
assembled in the work of art into a unity which gives form to the aesthetic 
idea•). 
It is at this point that transformation ceases (first imitation, then rep­
resentation and finally formation) and exact formation with exact means 
begins (see chapter ~Expression and expressional means of the aesthetic 
experience') (Fig. 16-17). 
The artist is also expressing reality in this formative abstraction, but in 
a different way, that is, in the way of art and it is, indeed, a deeper reality 
that that which was expressed in imitation of the discovered object of per­
ception. 
By a process of formation with purely aesthetic means the artist gives 
reality a new shape. 
This is the point to which visual art has developed in our time. 
e ) In this process of assembling there is still, of course, room for spiritual intuition, assuming that the 
artist does not wish his work t o degenerate straight away into desiccat ed abstraction. 
Spiritual creative intuition must, however, always be subject t o rational control.
