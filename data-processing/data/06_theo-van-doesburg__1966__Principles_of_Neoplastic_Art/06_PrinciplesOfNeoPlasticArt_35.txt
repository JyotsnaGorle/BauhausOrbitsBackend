He has used literary, symbolic, religious means or means in which ideas 
were evoked by an object, so as to give his work an 'intellectual' accent. 
As the creation of an original image is to copying, as writing a story is 
t o telling it, as composing a song to singing it, so is exact formative art to 
art which is not exact but contains associative ideas. 
If the observer's relationship to a classical work of art is not artistic

Once when I was with someone visiting a museum in which Greek and

broadly conceived planes and dimensions of the Egyptian sculptures. 
I n these sculptures he admired only irrelevancies. He tried to decipher 
them by gr aphological methods as though they were some symbolic writ­

Later when I showed him two modern pictures in one of which a few 
playing cards had been used in the composition, he commented 'skat party'. 
The other picture, in which the composition was carried out in purely 
painterly terms, by confronting rectangular planes without any refer­
ence to perceptible natural objects, he described as a box of bricks. 
In all four cases, with the Greek and Egyptian sculptures as well as
