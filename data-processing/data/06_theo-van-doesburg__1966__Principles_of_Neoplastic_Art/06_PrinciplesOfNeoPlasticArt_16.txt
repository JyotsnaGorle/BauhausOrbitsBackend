no details, since particular features of the object do not interest him. The 
artist experiences animal and environment in organic cohesion. Should 
the animal begin to move, there will be new experiences for the artist. He 
observes a definite periodicity and a repetition of unequal movements 
which he experiences as rhythm. The body of the animal, which the artist 
need no longer remember as such, seems to him to multiply in space 
because of these movements. Not as a physical creature, but abstractly in 
the formative imagination of the artist. 
The laws of creation are apparent in the aesthetic or formative vision; in 
visual art, for example, the balancing relationships of mass, colour, space, 
etc. We call these relationships aesthetic accents and to a greater 
or lesser degree every artist regards them as the most essential element in 
his work, in so far as he is concerned with visual art and nothing else. 
X Ill. The stronger the aesthetic experience the more completely > 
will the objective, natural appearance of the object of the exper- ..-足
ience be annihilated. 
This means: (in terms of our example) the cow as draught-animal, 
as source of food, as product for sale; in a word: the natural animal disap足
pears and becomes for the formative artist a complex of formative aes足
thetic accents, in colour-relationships, formal relationships, contrasts, 
tensions, etc. The fact that the environment which surrounds the animal 
(ground, air and background) belongs also to the complex of these rela足
tionships constitutes another difference from the manner in which the 
veterinary surgeon, the farmer, etc., see the cow. For them, the ground 
and the things in the environment of the object of the experience do not 
/ 
form a whole with the cow- at least, not an organic whole; for the artist, 
however, they do; in the formative vision everything is equalized, i.e. , 
enters into relationships, because by their nature the artist's experiences 
synthesize.
