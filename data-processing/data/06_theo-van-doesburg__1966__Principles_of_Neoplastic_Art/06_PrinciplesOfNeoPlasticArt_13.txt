SECOND CHAPTER 
THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 
Art is therefore the expression which corresponds to our purely aesthetic 
experience of reality. 
We may conclude from this that when the content of the artist's active 
experiences is aesthetic, the expression of these experiences must have a 
similar content. 
VIII. The content of all arts is the same. Only modes and means of 
expression are different. 
Visual art, for example, is the exclusively plastic expression of the 
aesthetic experience (using space, volume, colour), music the exclusively 
phonetic expression of the aesthetic experience (using time and sound) , etc. 
I X. Aesthetic experience and expression of the experience mutually 
determine one another. 
~ X. The aesthetic experience is expressed in relationships. 
XI. These relationships become apparent within the expressional 
means proper to each form of art. 
The expressional means of the various arts arise out of the contrast 
between positive and negative elements. 
The organization of relationships (positive and negative) with one anoÂ­
ther as determined by aesthetic vision is the essence of creative activity. 
X II. The most powerful expressional form of any art is achieved 
by using only the means proper to each. 
If the formation of the aesthetic experience of reality is kept within the 
bounds of the expressional means proper to each art, each branch of art 
is pure and genuine in itself (see Fig. 1-4).
