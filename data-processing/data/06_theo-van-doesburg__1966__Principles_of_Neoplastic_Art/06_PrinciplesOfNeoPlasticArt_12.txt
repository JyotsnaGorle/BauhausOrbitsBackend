Sensory, psychic or intellectual expenence of reality may be either 
passive or active. If an experience evokes an outward reaction we call 
it active, if it does not evoke reaction we call it passive. The deeper 
(psychic and intellectual) experience of reality may, if the experience is 
active, produce the impulse to objectivize the experience in material shape, 
i.e., to form (gestalten). 
VI. The essence and occasion of all art lies in this formative reacÂ­
tion of our active experience of reality. 
VII. The work of art is the expressional or formative aspect of this 
intellectual, active experience of reality. 
The intellectual active experience of reality is aesthetic. The intellectual 
passive experience of reality is ethical.
