Ill. 
I summarise the current consequences of this situation: 
1. In the exact mechanical procedures of photography and the film we 
possess an expressional means for representation which works incompar­
ably better than did the manual procedures of the representational paint­
ing we have known hitherto. 
From now on painting can concern itself with pure colour composition. 
2. Pure colour composition shows that the 'theme' of colour composition 
(painting) is colour itself, that with colour, without objective references, 
a pure and primary, a composed expression, can be achieved. 
3. The newly invented optical and technical instruments offer the optical 
creator valuable suggestions; among other things they give us light paint­
ing side by side with painting in pigment, kinetic painting side by side 
with static. (Moving light displays side by side with easel-painting, 
instead of frescos - films in all dimensions; outside the film theatre, too, 
of course.)

I do not wish with these remarks to pass value judgments on the 
various modes of painterly creation, but simply to classify those 
optical creations vvhich exist or could exist today in the sense of the 
application of means. The quality of a work need not be dependent 
absolutely on a 'modern' or an 'old' theory of composition. It is 
dependent on the degree of inventive intensity which finds its tech­
nically appropriate form. All the same, it seems to me indispensable 
that we, the creators of our own time, should go to work with up-to­
date means.
