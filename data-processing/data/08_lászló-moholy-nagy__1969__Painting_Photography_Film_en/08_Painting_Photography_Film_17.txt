STATIC 
AND I<INETIC 
OPTICAL COMPOSITION 
The development of new technical means has resulted in the emergence 
of new fields of creativity; and thus it is that contemporary technical 
products, optical apparatus: the spotlight, the reflector, the electric 
sign, have created new forms and fields not only of representation but also 
of colour composition. Pigment has hitherto been the major means of col­
our composition, has been recognised as such and used both for easel paint­
ing and in its capacity of 'building material' in architecture. The medie­
val stained-glass window alone marks a different notion, but one that was 
not consistently carried through. These windows produced a certain am­
ount of radiant spatial reflection in addition to the colours of the planes. 
The moving, coloured figures (continuous light displays), however, which 
are today deliberately screened with a reflector or projector open up new 
expressional possibilities and therefore new laws. 
For centuries efforts have been made to produce a light-organ or a colour­
piano. The experiments conducted by Newton and his pupil Father Castel 
are famous. The same problem has engaged the attention of many savants 
since their day. In our time the experiments of Scriabin have been pioneer­
works. He accompanied his Prometheus Symphony, first performed in 
New York in rgr6, with beams of colour simultaneously projected into 
the room by means of spotlights. Thomas Wilfred's Clavilux (America, 
c.rgzo) was an apparatus resembling a laterna magica with which chang­
ing non-objective pictorial variations were shown. The efforts of Walter 
Ruttman (Germany), who early enlisted the aid of the film camera in his 
experiments, represented an important advance in this direction. Most 
important, however, were the works of VIKING EGGELING (Sweden), 
who died prematurely. Eggeling- the first after the Futurists to do so -
