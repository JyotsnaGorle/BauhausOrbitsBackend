ON THE 
OBJECTIVE 
AND THE NON-OBJECTIVE 
The biological functions of colour, its psycho-physical effects, have as yet 
scarcely been examined. One thing, however, is certain: it is an elemen­
tary biological necessity for human beings to absorb colour, to extract 
colour. We must assume that there are conditions of colour relationships 
and tensions, light values, forms, positions, directions which are common 
to all men and determined by our physiological mechanisms. E.g., com­
plementary colours, the ways in which colours can be arranged centrically 
and eccentrically, centrifugally and centripetally, values of brightness and 
darkness- black and white content- the warmth and coldness of colours, 
their advancing and receding movements, the lightness and weight of 
colours. 
Biologically conditioned expression of these relationships or tensions­
be it conscious or unconscious - results in the concept of absolute 
painting. In fact these conditions have at all times been the true 
content of colour composition. I.e. the paintings of every age must have 
been formed from these primal states of tension grounded in man. The 
observable variations between the painting of different periods can be 
explained only as periodic formal variations of the same phenomenon. 
In practical terms this means that a painting - quite apart from its 
so-called (theme' -must make its effect simply through the harmony 
of its colours and its chiaroscuro. E.g. a picture could be standing on 
1ts head and still provide a sufficient basis for an assessment of 
its worth as a painting. Of course, neither its use of colour nor its 
representational intentions (that is, its objectivity only) fully accounts for 
the character of a painting of the earlier periods of art. Its character is 
revealed only in the inseparable conjunction of the two. It is difficult
