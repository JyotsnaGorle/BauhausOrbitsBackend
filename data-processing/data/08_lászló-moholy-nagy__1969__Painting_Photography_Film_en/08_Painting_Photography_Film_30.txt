THE -FUTURE OF THE 
PHOTOGRAPHIC 
PROCESS 
Creative use of this knowledge and these principles will silence those who 
contend that photography is not an 'art'. 
The human mind everywhere finds fields in which it can work creatively. 
Thus we shall very soon have to record great progress in the field of 
photography too . 
• 
Photography when used as a representational art is not a mere copy of 
nature. This is proved by the rarity of the 'good' photograph. Only now 
and then does one find really 'good' photographs among the millions which 
appear in illustrated papers and books. What is remarkable in this and at 
the same time serves as proof is that (after a fairly long visual culture) 
we always infallibly and with sure instinct discover the 'good' photos, 
quite apart from the novelty or unfamiliarity of the 'thematic' content. 
We have gained a new feeling for the quality of chiaroscuro, shining white, 
transitions from black to grey imbued with fluid light, the precise magic of . 
the finest texture: in the framework of steel buildings just as much as in 
the foam of the sea- and all fixed in a hundredth or thousandth fraction of 
a second . 
• 
Since as a rule light phenomena offer greater possibilities of differentiation 
in motion than in the static condition, all photographic processes reach 
their highest level in the film (relationships between the motions of the 
light projections). 
Film practice has so far been largely restricted to reproducing dramatic 
action without, however, fully utilising the potentialities of the camera
