It is time that we become human again and let the human seale rule over all our 
ventures. Tbe man in equipoise we 1nust achieve is new only in contrast to a 
distorted period. He revives age-old demands which must be fulfilled in our own 
way if our civilization is not to collapse. 
Every generation must carry both the burden of the past and the responsibility 
for the future. The present is coming to be seen more and more as a mere link 
between yesterday and tomorrow. 
We are little concerned with the question whether man will ever attain a state 
of infinite perfection. We are closer to the ancient wisdom that saw in a possible 
moral evolution the course the world would take. 
Tllis does not mean that we must resign ourselves to cruelty, hopelessness, or 
despair. Every generation has to find a different solution to the same problem: 
to bridge the abyss between im1er and outer reality hy re-establishing the 
dynamic equilibrium that governs their relationships.
