the vehicle into a sleeping apartment: (US Patent 278,431, 29 May 1883) 
The whole construction is aerial and hovering as the nest of an insect. EveryÂ­
thing here is based on mobilit)', on a S)'Stem of interlocking parts 'compOiled of 
a number of jointed links or boughs and legs and suitable cross-rounds .... 
The footrest is not connected rigid!)' with the framework of the chair, but is

sustained b)' a flexible connection.' 
This is not the place to quote from the detailed specification. But whoever 
would see for himself with what ease and competence the period had mastered 
motion problems ma)' peruse the actual wording of the patent. He will need 
no further explanation wh)' we stress the carefree manner, the originalit)' with 
which the Americans of the period exorcised the spell that the ruling taste had 
cast over furniture. 
The Hammock and Alexander Calder 
From this hovering S)'Stem, ever read)' to change its poise, there is but a step 
to the art of the American sculptor, Alexander Calder. Both are intimate!)' 
rooted in the American environment. Indeed, Calder's art- and herein lies 
its strength -is deep!)' at one with the broad stream of modern evolution.
