5. E. J. MAREY: Recording Larger Movements-Flight, 1868. To trace the more extensive movements 
of a bird in flight, Marey harnessed a pigeon to lhe arm of a merry-go-round. The wings, connected to pneu~ 
malic drums, record their trajedory on a cylinder. 
form a bridge to Marcy's activity. Marey unites the genius of the experimental 
physiologist with that of the engineer. He is inexhaustible, in the first half of 
his career, as'8.u inventor of a 'recording apparatus' (fig. 2) whose needles register 
the movement on smoked cylinders." The forms that develop often have a 
fascination all of their own (figs. 3,4). These curves, says the savant, Inight 
11 
be called the 'language of phenomena themselves.' Early in the 'eighties 
Marey began to use photography. 
to When Marey studied the flight of birds he constructed a working model of a monoplane having two 
propellers (1872) driven by a compressed air motor (today at MusCe de l'Aeronautique, Paris). In 1886 
he invented daylight~loading film. And with the first movie camera (which contained all essential parts), 
he made a brief scene of a man climbing off a bicycle in the Champs~ElysOOs.
