of the streamline form in the objects of daily use aims to produce an artificial 
swelling of volumes. 
One need only leaf tbrongb the design patents (the legal force of which was 
176
considerably strengthened in the time of streamline design ) to observe how 
year hy year the casings, frmn autonlObile to vacuum cleaner, become increas­
ingly bloated. If one compares such a casing with its manifold profiles to the 
idiom used at the French Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs of 1925, 
the historieal origins of 'streamline style' become obvious. A Parisian lighting 
fixture (fig. 430), with its swollen profile of sheet metal thrice repeated, and 
the 'streamline' casing for a vacuum cleaner (fig. 431) are, in their formal struc­
ture, one and the same. 
French decorative art of 1925 was a sterile mixture of Art Nouveau and Ger­
man arts and crafts. Like the furniture of the upholsterer in the Second Empire, 
its influence beeame world-wide. Its over-profiled furniture, ornaments, and 
lighting fixtures wielded a remarkable fascination. Even in the 'forties, the 
control board of automatic ranges, like the dashboards of automobiles, show 
that the public is still in the grip of the trend. 
Streamline style, as we have seen, also brought forth improvements of form 
and new types. Its influence did more than inflate the sheet metal like the plush 
coverings of the confortables of the upholsterers. Refonnistic tendencies cannot 
be overlooked when one compares a household appliance of 1940 with one of 
1914. Nevertheless, both succmnb to the temptation of lending the objects a 
heavier and more impressive aspect. 
Thus, in a strange way the principles of nineteenth-century ruling taste linger 
on into the twentieth.
