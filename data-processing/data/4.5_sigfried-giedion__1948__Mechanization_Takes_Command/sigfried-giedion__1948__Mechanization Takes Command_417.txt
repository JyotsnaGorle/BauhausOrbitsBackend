238. Rocking and Rotating Chairs, 
1855. The so-called qffu:e chair was orig~ 
irwlly iniended.for the Jwme.Jor 'invalids, 
parlor, drawing~room, library, counting 
house, ojJwe or garden.' In the following 
decades it was reduced to a desk chair. 
Unforlurw.lely this means of perfect re~ 
loxation lws so far been neglecfed by jut~ 
nifure designers and architects. (Ameri­
can Portrait Gallery, vol. III, New York, 
1855) 
those of the ruling taste. Their voluminous bodies are belied by the subtle 
thought behind their construction. 
A person accustomed to a rigid type of chair bas first to learn this mode of 
sitting in which body and mechanism collaborate, for in contrast with rigid 
sitting, the body must do its share. A frrst condition is to sit fully relaxed. The 
knees, ankles, and toe joints form part and parcel of the chair's mechanism; it 
is they that regulate the position of the body backwards, forwards, or sideways, 
so far as circumstances or relaxation require. The pivots of the movement are 
the toes and balls of the feet. They are the fulcra. They are the constant regu­
lators of the movement, never losing their activity. In a bumble way they act 
as the ankles of a ballet-dancer in the heel-toe. 
- Relaxation of the body is not induced by stuffing, but is achieved by a method 
of seating, both resilient and oscillating; by movement forwards, backwards, or 
sideways, in reaching, or in any other spontaneous motion. Such unconscious 
shifts of position avoid the cramps that easily trouble the sitter in rigid seating.
