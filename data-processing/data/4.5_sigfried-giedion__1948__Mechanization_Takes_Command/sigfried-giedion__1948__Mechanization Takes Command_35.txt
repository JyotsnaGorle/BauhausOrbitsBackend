Marey invited Muybridge to visit him in Paris (1881), and introduced him 
in his house to a gathering of Europe's most brilliant physicists, astronomers, 
and physiologists, who welcomed Muyhridge's straightforward tackling of the 
problem. 
Muyhridge's photography of flying birds did not entirely satisfy Marey, 
who wished to gain full insight into the three-dimensional character of flight­
as Descartes had projected geometrical forms: for the flight of insects and of

birds is spatial. It evolves freely in three dimensions. Around 1835 Marcy 
pointed three cameras in such a way as to view the bird simultaneously from 
above, from the side, and from the fore (fig. 7). At his laboratory in the Pare 
des Princes, Paris, he set up a vast hangar, before whose black walls and ceiling 
the sea gull flew over a black floor. These simple realities, normally hidden to 
the human eye, have an impressiveness that needs no further explanation. 
For better knowledge of the hird's flight, Marcy later drew diagrams in which 
he separated the overlapping phases of the photograph (figs. 8-10). He even 
modeled the sea gull in its successive attitudes (fig. 9) -sculpture that would 
have delighted Boccioni, creator of the 'Bottle evolving in Space' (1912) and 
13 
of the 'Marching Man' (1913). In his later research Marcy made extensive 
use of the movie camera, which proved not especially suited to this purpose.
