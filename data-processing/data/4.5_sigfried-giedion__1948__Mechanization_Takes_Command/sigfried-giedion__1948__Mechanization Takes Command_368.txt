203. OWEN JONES: Horse-Chestnut Leaves Pressed onto a Flat Surface. 1856. The reformers of the 
'fifties fried to escape eclecticism and 'arrest lhal unfortunate tendency of our time to be content with copying, 
while the fashion ln.sf,s, the jorrm peculiar to any bygone age.' Owen Jones arranges the leaves of the horseÂ­
chestnut tree over the whole page, without light and shade, in pure lines and conionrs. He is moving in the 
diruiion of the late nineteenth-century's' Art nouveau.' (Owen Jones, Grammar of Ornament, London, 1856)
