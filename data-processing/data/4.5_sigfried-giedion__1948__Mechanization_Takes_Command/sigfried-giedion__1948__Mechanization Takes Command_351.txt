room by L. M_ Berthault.. 1798. 
The drapes painted on the uJall, the 
real drapery wiih double row of 
fringes, the dCcor of candelabras, 
statuette, bed table, and flower stand

in them the spatial dissolves into the decorative, which overruns everything. 
Sheraton would cnt lock shields out of plain metal or leave them entirely 
undecorated. Now they hecome the pretext for bright, gilded hronze, in strong 
contrast with the red mahogany, The gilded metal is affixed not on the locks 
only, hut in all possible places. Other periods have seen ornament pass from 
the delicate to the florid; hut now ornament dazzles the eye; and, proclaiming 
the difference of its material, strikes a jarring note. 
THE DEVALUATION OF SYMBOLS 
Behind all this is the reminiscence of imperial Rome. From the Renaissance 
on, the Classical panoply had served time and again: arahesques, trophies, 
torches, the horn of plenty, pahns as used hy Rohert Adam, the Roman eagle 
with thunderholts, the Romau fasces, the swan, the geuii, the winged victory 
heariug laurels in her outstretched hand, Pegasus aud griffons, sphinxes, Hermes, 
lion heads, hehned warrior heads or Olympian scenes, symhols of power and 
fame. Singly or in groups, this treasury of emblems is spread upon the walls or, 
in miniature fonn, nailed to furniture. 
The variety of emblems on the power and fame motif is ahnost in1possible to 
digest. That Percier and Fontaine handled them with great elegance hecomes 
clear hy contrast with what was created elsewhere in imitation of the French.
