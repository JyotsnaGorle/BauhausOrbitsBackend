The coffer-bench comists of a regular chest with a backpiece added. It was 
later reduced to the box-chair, an uncommon piece soon displaced by the cbair. 
The dresser or court cupboard is a chest raised upon styles. It makes its 
appearance early in tbe fifteenth century as a small square receptacle on slender 
legs- a companion piece, as it were, to the box-chair. It stood free within 
the room. Later in the fifteenth century it broadened into the dresser or side·· 
board with high backpiece. 
Even tbe table unexpectedly turned into a receptacle. Often a whole array 
of caskets and drawers might be housed beneath it, tbe receptacle narrowing 
somewhat toward the base, since the sitter's feet could not he altogether ignored.
