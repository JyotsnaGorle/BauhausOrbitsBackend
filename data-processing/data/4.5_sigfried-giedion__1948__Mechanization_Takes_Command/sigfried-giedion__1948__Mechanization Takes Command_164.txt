the very start (1786), came to the principle of continuous rotation, the goal of 
all mechanization, In 1811 there was patented a reaper (fig, 76) with a circular 
cutting blade set on the periphery of a conical drum," In other words, the prin­
02 
ciple of the circular saw was here applied to the culling of wheat, Wheat 
stalks, however, are neither trees nor planks, Although attempted again and 
again, continuous rotation did not lead to the goaL"

One of the many efforts

The large rotating drum

borrow the principle of 
the circular sam (The

The stalks would have to be cut as the hand implement cut them: stroke by 
stroke, along a steady line of progress, The sickle-wielding hand cuts a seg­
mental swathe, With the machine this could become a straight one, Instead 
of the scythe, short triangular teeth were aligned side by side, Fixed iron fingers 
held the stalks while the teeth cut them down, but just as with the scythe: 
stroke by stroke, At intervals a large reel laid down as many stalks as the teeth 
could cut in one motion, And so it has remained to this day, 
It soon became evident that grass behaved differently from the hollow stalks, 
cut when longer fmgers were used, 54 These long-

Concerning the history of agriculture and the growth of reapers, including the American phase, we 
are incomparably better informed than in the caf!e of mechanization in industry, The bibliography pre~ 
pared by Everett K Edwards, published by the Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, gives some idea 
of the breadth of the material, We are indebted in the first line to our friend and dtre.ctor of the McCor~ 
mick Historical Association, Herbert A, Kellar, who during our research at the Institute unselfishly 
opened to us this richest repository of source material for the history of agriculture, Neither should we 
forget the farmers of Houses Point, in the north of New York State, who acquainted us with the advan~ 
tages and drawbacks of their agricultural machiner-y, and Mr, Earle Woodroffe, farmer, of Perkasiet 
Buck's Co,, Pa,, with whom we reaped corn, 
M Obey Hussey's ma<::hine, which at first outstripped McCormick's reaper, is based on this arrange~ 
ment.
