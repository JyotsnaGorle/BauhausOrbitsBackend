Klee's elucidation of an artistic problem comes astonishingly close to the frame­
work of Oresme's thought. Nothing is static. A line, he begins, 'an activated 
line, a line moving freely along, is a stroll for strolling's sake. Its performer is a 
point in transit.' ;,s Everything for him is the outcome of motion, even the 
circle, which, plastically speaking, seems to rest in itself- and which geometry 
defines as a curve whose points are at an equal distance from the center. For 
Klee the circle originates in the rotation of a pendulum. And from the circle 
Klee develops 'The Spiral' (fig. 59), 1925, a spiral-head crowns the 'Queen of 
Hearts' (fig. 58), 1921.

'The moving spiral originates with the 
lengthening radiu.~. Shortening the radiw 
progressively narrows the circumference till 
the beautiful spectacle dies suddenly when 
it reaches a poini of stasis. Movement rw 
longer being infinite, the que.~lion of direction 
becomes decisi11e.' (Klee, Pedagogical
