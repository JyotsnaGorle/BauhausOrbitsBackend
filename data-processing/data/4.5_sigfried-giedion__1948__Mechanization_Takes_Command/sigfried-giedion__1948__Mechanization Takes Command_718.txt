modeled.' Then partial mechanization set in, rmsmg productivity to ten 
baths per worker per day, or five times the rate of the 'nineties. 
No satisfactory picture can be given of the rise of the double-shell enameled 
bathtub, for the pioneer firms are often at variance in their accounts. The 
enmneled bathtub cmnc to the fore around 1910. The first patents for built-in 
tubs were granted in 1913. These types were enameled on the inside only. The 
outside surface was painted over or tiled in (as is still the European practice) 
107 
or concealed by a separate one-piece enmneled apron.
Not until 1916 did it become possible to manufacture the one-piece, doubleÂ­
shell, cast-iron, enmneled bathtub in mass production. Made-to-order examples 
of this type are said to have first been used in private Pullmans before 1900-
108 
being as elegant as the porcelain tubs, and much lighter. Mass production 
(aided, an official of a Chicago mail-order house informs us, through billboard 
brought the recessed tub to a far broader class of consumers. In 
advertising) 
1940 the mail-order houses were selling the full set of fixtures- tub, basin, 
toilet- for around $70, as against the $200 price of the porcelain bathtub alone 
109 
in the Crane (Chicago) catalogue for 1910.
Due to the sparse and often completely lacking historical data, we sent out 
questionnaires in order to obtain an approximate picture of the development. 
A smnple questionnaire and reply are here reproduced in full. The thorouglmess 
of this answer, returned by Crane and Co., Chicago, was, however, not paralleled 
in every case. 
Questionnaire 
QUESTION 1. When did mass production of the one-shell enameled built-in bathtub 
begin? 
ANSWER. Roll-rim tubs on feet in enameled iron, according to our records, started 
about 1893. Enameled tubs on legs with wood roll rim began ahout 1892 
to 1895. Copper-lined wood bathtubs started about 1883 and continued 
in popularity until ahout 1898. Single shell or one-shell tubs began ahout 
1910 and some manufacturers are making them at the present time. 
Q. 2. When did mass production of the double-shell enameled built-in bathtub 
begin? 
A. Doublc~shell enameled iron tubs were introduced in about 1915 and manu~
