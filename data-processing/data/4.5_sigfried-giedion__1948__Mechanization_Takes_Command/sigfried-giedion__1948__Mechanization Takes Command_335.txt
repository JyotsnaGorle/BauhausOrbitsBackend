182. \VILLIAM MORRIS: Sideboard. c.l880. Morris made sel!eral such sideboards. The elegantly 
curued front shows his close ties with the eighteenth century. Without the elaborate display of china, the bond 
would f1e even more apparent. (Courtesy Mr. Marillier, Morris g Co. Art Workers Ltd., London) 
in contrast to France of the Rococo, loses influence. The gentleman sets the 
tone. He is not limited to the ranks of nobility; he does not have to be born 
into a ti tie; he belongs to no closed social class; increasingly, he becomes identified 
with a moral concept. 
By 1710 Steele was thus defming him in The Taller: 'The appelation of Gentle­
man is never to be affixed to a Man's circumstances, but to his behaviour in 
them.' And Chippendale entitles his famous catalogue (1754) The Gentleman 
and Cabinellllllker's Guide. Besides the nobility, the great cabinetmakers num­
bered among their clients the middle class, artists, actors. And the designs in 
Hepplewhite's, Shearer's, and Sheraton's hooks show that their wares are 
intended for the newly rising classes." 
As the gentleman passes from the feudal into the middle-class atmosphere, 
certain rooms of the mansion pass into the middle-class dwelling.

It bas been pointed out that !.be foreword to George Hepplewhite's Cuhinel-Maker's and Upholsterer's 
Guide (1787) makes no appeal t.o t.h~ nobility and gmt.ry, but addresses itself t.o 'the residents of London.'
