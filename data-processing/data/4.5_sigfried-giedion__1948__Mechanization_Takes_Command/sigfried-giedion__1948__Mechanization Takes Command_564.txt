375. Formulation of the Type: Dishwasher, 1865. 'After the water has been Otrown outward amon{l the 
dishes it will flow back again. to the center. The plates are made to occupy a position tangential to permd the 
wafer to be thrown in between them.' (U.S. Patenl5I,OOO, 21 Nanember 1865) 
the start of our chronological list: the year 1850. This machine with rotary 
inner drum was mainly used in large-scale laundering, and is so used today. 
But if we seek a date for the type that, with the coming of electrical propul­
sion, was to prevail in household use, we are taken to the end of our chronological 
62 
list: the year 1869. The hody of this type is cylindrical, tapering slightly 
upwards. A four-bladed rotor at the bottom of the tub drives a current of water 
through the fahrics. This rotor, agitator, or gyrator is driven by a shaft that 
passes down through the tub bottom (fig. 377). 
Anyone who has a feeling for elegant and precise construction will see in the 
compact moving parts of its drive~ crank, connecting bar, and bevel ge<~r ~ 
a well-thought-out model seemingly earmarked for success. But it had a long 
while to wait. Six decades after this hand-driven model, the great rush to mecha­
nize the household set in. The year 1929 alone saw fifteen patents for this gyrator 
type, which was im{'roved in many points without departure from the principle. 
Whether the machine is hand-driven and equipped with primitive blades, as 
in 1869; whether it is electrically driven, while the blades, carefuly modeled and 
broadened, are made of aluminum or plastic; whether the simple rotary move­
ment is made reversible~ all these are details added by successors. Later
