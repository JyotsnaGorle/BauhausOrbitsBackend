Suggestions for adding vitamins to the dough date from the late 'twenties. 
They were not carried out on a large scale until 1940, when vitamins were raised 
into a public preoccupation." 'The American public bas been told that they 
can now obtain a new white bread containing vitamins and minerals natural 
to whole wheat.' so 
Mechanization Alters Public Taste 
Doubtless fine bread, like many other luxuries, was so cheapened in price 
through mass production as to become available to all. No King of France 
had bread of such white and silken quality on his table. But bread's position 
as the staff of life has been undermined. The complicated machinery of full 
mechanization has altered its structure and converted it into a body that is 
neither bread nor cake, but something half-way between the two. Whatever 
new enrichments may be devised, nothing can really help as long "" this sweetish 
softness continues to haunt its structure. 
If the type of bread preferred in the United States were pnt to the public 
vote, the verdict would not be hard to foresee. The 1939 Census tells the story: 
the quantity of white pan bread consumed is about four times that of rye or 
81 
whole wheat. And we may note that the whole-wheat bread is not unlike the 
white pan bread in frothiness and flavor, and that as a rule 40 to 50 per cent of 
highly refined white flour is mixed with rye bread; here too the L'fllst is kept as 
thin as possible. 
The change of taste through mechanization forms an even clearer picture 
when the quantity of white flour used in bread and otber bakery products in 
82 
1939 is compared to that of whole wheat (including graham). The ratio is 27 :1.
The adulteration of taste, similar to the one that accompanied the mechanizing 
of bread, was witnessed a century earlier in a quite different field. The ruling
