and the democratizing of comfort. The mechanical refrigerator becomes popular 
as soon as its price is standardized and maintained at a minimmn. 
Observing the time dimension, we see that a half-century elapsed before the 
principle was taken up by industry (in 1873-5), and another half-century before 
the borne refrigerator was made in considerable quantity. Despite external 
changes the standard form toward which it was moving at this tin1e is patterned 
on the old icebox. The early American refrigerators around 1919 had the same 
dark wood exterior as the old iceboxes. Later they were exposed, like the auto足
mobile, to the streamlining fashion, and their bulk was deliberately inflated for 
selling purposes. The refrigerator stood out in the American kitchen of the 
1930's as the sole element not yet incorporated with the unified working sur足
faces. Needless to say, it was improved year by year. The housewife learned 
to master its advantages and its pranks. Sbe knows what will and what will not 
keep, and how to protect foodstuffs from drying out. All in all, however, the 
standard form achieved after a hundred years was of strikingly short duration. 
When it emerged on the market a new refrigerating method was being patented, 
and when fmally in 1932 the mail-order houses entered it in their catalogues, 
quick-freezing equipment, destined to alter the very way of living, had already 
come on the market.
