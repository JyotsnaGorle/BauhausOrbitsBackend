We must establish a new balance 
between the individual and collective spheres. 
We must discriminate between those domains reserve,d for individual life and 
those in which a collective life may_be formed. We want neither extreme indi足
vidualism nor overpowering collectivism: we must distinguish between the rights 
of the individual and the rights of the community. Today, both the life of the 
individual and the life of the community are frustrated and lack real shape and 
structure. 
We must organize the world mnsidered as a whole, and at the same tin1e allow 
for the right of each region to develop its particular language, habits, customs. 
We must establish a new balance 
between the psychic spheres within the indi足
vidual. 
The relation between methods of thinking and of feeling is seriously impaired 
and even disrupted. The result is a split personality. Equipoise is lacking be足
tween the rational and the irrational; between the past- tradition - and the 
future- exploration of the unknown; between the temporal and the eternal. 
We must establish a new balance 
between the spheres of knowledge. 
The specialized approach has to be integrated with a universal outlook. Inven足
tions and discoveries must be integrated with their social implications. 
We must establish a new balance 
between the human body and cosmic forces. 
The human organism requires equipoise between its organic environment and 
its artificial surroundings. Separated from earth and growth, it will never attain 
the equilibrium necessary for life. 
These are only a few of the prerequisites of the new man. Some may regard them 
as futile and no more certain than sky writing. But we should not have dared 
to suggest the type of man our period calls for if physiology had not discovered 
astonishingly parallel trends.
