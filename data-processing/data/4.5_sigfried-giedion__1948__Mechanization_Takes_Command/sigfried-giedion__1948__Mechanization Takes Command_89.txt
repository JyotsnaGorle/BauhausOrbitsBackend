The W ooden-K'ey Type in Pennsylvania 
Everywhere in Pennsylvania, on barns and, perhaps in his day, still on farm­
houses, Yale could see the wooden tumbler locks brought by the settlers from 
Scotland, Germany, or Switzerland. Their tumblers were aligned in a single 
row (fig. 42). This type is a survival of Gothic life, as were tbe tools aud furni­
ture of the first settlers. The Pennsylvania Dutch often expressed their play­
fulness in inventing new devices which gave further variety to their wooden 
locks. But they had one type of wooden lock wbicb had closed medieval barns 
and houses. This wooden tumbler lock, with its aligned tumblers and flat, 
notched key, had long served as the lock of mankind. lts plain wooden frame, 
its simple grooves, the tumblers, and the key, all could be shaped hy the most 
primitive tools. 
It bespeaks the elemental vigor of this type that it remained current down to 
the nineteenth century, and could supply a decisive impulse· when the mecha­
nized lock of our period had to be invented. It was the rustic simplicity of this 
lock that provoked the stroke of genius in Linus Yale's invention: to align the 
tumblers one behind another in a row, so simply and efficiently that tbe scheme 
has never since been altered.
