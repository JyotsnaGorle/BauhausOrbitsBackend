The 1'runsmutability of Plane Surfaces 
The sometimes grotesque effect of things promiscuously comhined is a 
by-product. Worthy of interest is the aggressive plowing into inherited objects 
and the changing of them down to their very roots. This is performed in mul足
tiple-function furniture with the same thoroughgoing vigor that mechanized 
the doorlock and tools as simple as the hammer and plane, recasting forms that 
had stiffiy preserved their identity through tl1e centuries. 
Our folding armchair of 1869, which one motion transforms into a reclining chair 
(fig. 258), called for no mechanism unknown to the frfteentb century. The furni足
ture of the nineteenth century (table, sofa, bed, chair) is composed of various 
mobile planes entering into variahle combinations with one another and even 
changing their significance. The seat of this chair of 1869 becomes a foot rest 
simply by folding downwards; the same phenomenon can be observed in a 
swivel chair of 1875, where the back reeSt changes into a horizontal plane (fig. 
261), or again in an armchair of 1874 (fig. 262), where the seat becomes the head足
rest of a sofa. This process we call the transmutability of plane surfaces. In 
certsin medieval types we can speak of the transmutahility of planes. The
