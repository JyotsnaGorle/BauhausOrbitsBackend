of inch-thick pipes connected with coils passing through the fire box. 'It has 
before been proposed to heat ovens by the circulation of hot water in branch 
channels made in cast plates,' he stresses in his patent. He claims only the 'dis足
tribution of heat by a series of branches' of circulating pipes. 
This closes the series of types that came to perfection only when bread making 
reached the fully mechanized stage, mainly after 1910. In contrast to the steam

The Oven and the Endless Belt 
Ariberl, whose aerotherme oven (1832) with its plates running on rails pointed 
to a clearly mechanizing trend, called his invention a four continu, continuously 
working oven. Around 1850 efforts in this field focused on bringing about con足
tinuous operation by means of a moving mechanism within the baking chamber. 
The ordinary hot-air ovens could be heated continuously, but changing the 
loaves took t.oo mueh time. Trained workers were needed to manipulate the 
peel, the flat wooden shovel with the long handle used to introduce and remove 
the loaves.
