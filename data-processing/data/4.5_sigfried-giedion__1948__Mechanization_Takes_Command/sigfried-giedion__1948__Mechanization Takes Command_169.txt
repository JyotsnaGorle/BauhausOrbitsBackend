of ways. Finally two young farmers from Illinois, C. W. and W. W. Marsh, 
succeeded. On their solitary farmstead, in 1858, they constnwted, with that 
adventurous spirit distinguishing the Middle-Western from the European farmer, 
a rough model of a mechanical reaper, on the platform of which they fixed a 
table. An inclined endless helt delivered the stalks to the table top; standing on 
the platform, two men hound the sheaves and cast them from the advancing 
machine to the ground.

The essential idea of the Marsh brothers, which 
doned, lay in conveying the grain to a higher level (elevated delivery). The belt 
conveyor, so closely bound up with mechanization in America- Oliver Evans, 
1784- was used here again with almost magical effect. Actually there were 
two, a lower conveyor carrying the grain from the platform; an upper conveyor 
close above (fig. 82). The stalks were transported between them up an incline 
and down the other side to the working surface. This roof-shaped arrangement 
(fig. 81) was to become the distinctive feature of later reapers, even when, replac­
ing the two men, an automat took over the binding and knotting. Thus around 
1890 the inventor conld remark with understandable pride that the Marsh 
Harvester 'has never changed materially, in principle or form, since; and if the 
san1e old machine as used in 1858 and painted as others now are, were seen stand-
