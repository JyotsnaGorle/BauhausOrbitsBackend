As Graham proclaimed in 1832 with unrestrruned zealotry: 'Wnile the people 
of our country are so entirely given up as they are at present ... to the untiring 
pursuit of wealth it is perhaps wholly in vain for a single individual to raise his 
voice in a subject of this kind. . . . Whether my voice will be heard or not, I 
106 
will obey the dictate of my sense of duty ... .' 
As Graham foresaw, his voice went unheard. No one could have stemmed 
the course of the nineteenth century. Today, his endeavors to reconcile man 
with the organic take on their full timeliness and urgency.
