ice plane is used io clean the frozen surface of the 
pond. 'When the plane has r::ndered the ice smooth, 
the marker marks the field in (Jlock.'( 22 by 32 inches. 
The ice plough is used to finish off ihe work begun 
by the marker. Each of its teeth will cut about a 
quarter inch of ice, so that a plough with 8 teeth will 
' 
go through about 2 inches each time it passes along 
' 
the grooves.' The blocks are broken up and manipu足
laledwith ice-hook (A); fork-splitting bar (B); groov足
ing bar (C); channel hook bar (D). (Appleton's

has its continuation in quite unexpected form today. George Washington had 
a large icehouse on his Mount Vernon estate. At first icehouses were dug into 
the ground, as in Europe, the excavation being covered hy a roof. The above足
ground icehouse, as Cununings notes, was introduced in the early nineteenth 
century; it was constructed with double walls and doors on the principle of the 
ice stores of the ships that exported ice to the West Indies. Wastage was thus

reduced from 60 per cent to less than 8 per cent.
Export of natural ice to the tropics began with shipments to Martinique in 
1805, to Cuba ten years later, and in 1833 on the famous clijlper ships to Cal足
cutta, where a triple-walled ice store held 30,000 tons of ice. 
Cutting and storing ice in large quantities for export and for domestic supply is [1872] 
a strictly American enterprise, which began nearly seventy years ago, and from a small 
beginning has grown to a great business employing thousands of men and millions of
