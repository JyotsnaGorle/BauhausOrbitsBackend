77 
as friends.' 
Complains the worker: ' .â€¢. driven at an inhuman pace by foremen picked 
78 
for their brutality.' 
The advocate of scientific management, 1914: 'The speed boss does not drive 
the men at all. He is their servant. . . . The correct speed is the best speed at 
which the men can work day after day, year after year, and continuously improve 
79 
in health.' 
Complains the worker: 'There was never a moment of leisure or opportunity 
to turn my head. . . . The men have no rest except for fifteen or twenty minutes 
at lunch time and can go to the toilet only when substitotes are ready to relieve 
80 
them.'
