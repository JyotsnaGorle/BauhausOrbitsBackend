Poitevin, who dared to open a public bath in Paris, was well advised in seeking 
the medical endorsement of the 'Doyens et Doetcnrs Regcns' of the faculty, 
In a specially constructed ship anchored in the Seine, Poitevin placed cabins 
with warm baths and showers, to be used only upon a doctor's orders, 
How far this was from being an everyday practice is measurable by the fact 
that even Europe's most enlightened minds, the editors of the Great Ency足
clopedia (1755), defined the word douche (shower) as 'terme de ehirnrgie,'" 
Nevertheless such things were not beyond all discussion, for a few years 
after Poitevin's successful bath-boat in Paris, a medicinal bath on the Thames, 
'adapted to the cures of many diseases, not to he remedied by other known

means' was proposed in one of the few English patents of the time,

perfectibility of man, Through study of the child's mind, education according 
to nature, a new humanity would he formed, guided by tolerance and under足
standing: citizens of the world, 
Not only was intercourse between men to be harmoniously equilibrated; 
but in the individual, too, the balance of mind and body was to be maintained, 
The earliest practical pedagogical efforts in this direction appeared during the 
last decades of the eighteenth century, Gymnastics, running, jumping, swinl足
ming, become necessary elements of education, 
At Anhalt-Dessau, a small eighteenth-century German principality, Johann 
Bernhard Basedow (1723-90), moral philosopher and pedagogue, founded the 
educational institution which be nan1ed Philanthropin- school of human 
friendship for the teachers and the taught alike, On the fame of this philosopher's 
Book of Metlwds for Fathers and Mothers of Families and Peoples (1770), Leopold
