articles imitating the appearance of handmade objects. The rapid, mechanical stamping of ct•ins forms one 
of the starling points of mechanized adornment. (Charles Babbage, On the Economy of Machinery and

working stamping machines.' In one year, 1846, three patents dealt with 
mechanical processes for this method of reproduction. 
The call for machine-made adornment was reaching a peak. Between 1830 
and 1850 a whole arsenal of snbstitute materials was created, whose indelible 
effect is still at work today. 
Against Misuse of Mechanization: The English Reformers of 1850 
When was protest first raised against this abuse of mechanization? 
By 1850, industrialization in England, for good as well as for evil, was ahead 
of that in other countries. Here a few men of foresight had become alarmed at 
the state of man amid mechanization. Tbe organizing force of the movement

was Henry Cole (1808-82), an English civil servant, first noted for his preserva­
tion of medieval chronicles.

zo The compass of this hook does not allow us to become further acquainted with this interesting figure. 
We have dealt with the reforming movement of 1850 in an unpublished study lndustria.lisierung und 
Gefilhl (Industrialization and Feeling), based on Cole's manuscripts and diaries preserved in the Victoria 
and Albert Museum, London. Here we can hut fragmentarily touch upon the movement, and only in so 
far as Cole's activity impinges upon the mechanization of adornment. His important role in the mid­
century has been almost wholly forgotten. His writings, edited after his death hy his daughter, yield 
much infonnation concerning his efl'orts: Fifty Years of Public Work, 2 vols., London, 18M; also the 
40 volumes of his Miscellanies and Diaries.
