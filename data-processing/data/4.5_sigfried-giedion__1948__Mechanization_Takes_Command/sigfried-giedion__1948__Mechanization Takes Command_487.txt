303. The Hammock in Tropical Warfare: Nicaraguan Filibusters at Rest, 1855. The hammDck is among 
the very few furniture types that are native to the American continent. When Columbus and his crew landed in 
the Bahamus ln 1492 they found entire families sleeping in enormous hammocks or 'Brazil Beds,' as the 
English called them. Their use has never ceased in this tropical area. (Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 
9 May 1855) 
knew its practical value, and carried it with them. Frank Leslie's Illustrated 
Newspaper of 9 May 1355, reporting the Nicaraguan Rebellion of that year, 
takes us into a camp of filibusters at rest (fig. 303). At that stage the hammock 
had not yet become fashionable gnrden furniture for languid relaxation. The 
natural way these soldiers used theirs, having fastened them to ceiling and 
walls, may indicate that the hammock was then still their constant companion. 
MECHANIZATION OF THE HAMMOCK 
Now, in the 'eighties, attempts nre made to broaden the nse of this Indian 
furniture and to extract from it new combinations. The first danger for the 
inventor to meet was that the body might become enmeshed in the net like 
a snared animal, or that it might fall out if the hammock were not cautionsly 
nsed. Cross-bracing was to bold the net always at the right tension and, conÂ­

nected with it, a simple device to shelter the reclining lady from snn or rain 
(fig. 306).
