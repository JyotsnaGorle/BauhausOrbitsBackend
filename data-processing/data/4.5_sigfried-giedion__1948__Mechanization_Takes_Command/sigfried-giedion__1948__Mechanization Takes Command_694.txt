471. Shower for the Treat­
ment of Abdominal Maladies. 
}!..,ranee, c.l860. In France af 
the 'fifties and 'sixties Priess• 
nilz' s hydropathiC methods were 
refined and apparatus was de-­
veloped for increasingly special~ 
ized medical purposes. (L. 
Fleury, Traite tberapeutique) 
with roughly the same curve of popularity as the tuh. In the nineteenth century 
it may seem at times to enjoy an independent vogue, hut even then it would 
often form a unit in symbiosis with the hath. 
On the eopper-plate title page to a book much read during the eighteenth 
century, by one of Dr. Floyer's Germaa disciples," the shower appears in alle­
gorical form. Atlas, balancing the earthly sphere on his shoulders, causes a 
stream of water to gush out of its depths, whereby be irrigates the head of a 
bathing man (fig. 467) - an allusion to the primeval force of water and a 
reminiscence of what. mnst have been aa everyday sight around the fountains 
of medieval cities. 
The back-to-nature movement furthered the introduction of the shower just 
as it encouraged bathing of almost every type. Nevertheless even Priessnitz 
was more interested in its therapeutic value. As the century advances, the shower 
will rapidly outdistance the tub for two reasons: economy in use, and the influence 
of hydropathy. 
Originally the shower used a stream of water flowing down from rocks or 
poured from vessels overhead. Priessnitz employs both of these modes in their 
most primitive form (fig. 457). Such solid streams are used for cliniml pur­
poses by water healers of the 'fifties. The French in particular, not generally 
the leaders in this sphere, devised various technical methods (figs. 470, 471).
