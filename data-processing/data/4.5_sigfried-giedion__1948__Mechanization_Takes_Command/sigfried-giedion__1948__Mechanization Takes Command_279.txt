obtain in both places. Here is a motley gronp gathered around a hearth at 
which the woman in the foreground is making waffles. The man near by sprawls 
his mass over a small stool of the Romanesque tradition. Or is it a chair he is 
sitting on? With admirable directness, this engraving shows us how people 
used to sit: informally, at an angle, one arm thrown over the stumpy back 
rest. 
The rest of the gathering sit on whatever is handy: overturned baskets, stools 
of various heights- all of which suggest that it was not their wont to gather 
around a table. 
Here too everyone sits crowded together. The bodies touch. The often­
heard explanation that people are crowded in medieval pictures beeanse the 
artist wishes to portray as many as possible hardly seems plansible. Look 
into as many pictures as one will, all give the same account: Medieval 
society did not have chairs as we know them, and people took close seating for 
granted. 
We are accustomed to sit on chairs that leave an unavoidable gap between 
persons, holding each sitter apart from his neighbor. This habit has become 
ingrained in our behavior. Unlike people in the Middle Ages, we feel it distasteful 
to touch or he touched by our neighbor, and back apologetically away. · 
141. Upper Rhenish Interior, c.1450: 'Mary 
Bathing the Child,' School of Konrad Witz. The 
Virgin, whose rank is shown only by the cascading 
folds of her garment, may be sealed on a low stool, or 
on the floor itself, or on a cushion such as those that 
lie on the plain c/u:$ts lining the wall.
