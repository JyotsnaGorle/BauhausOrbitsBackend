Not until the end of the Gothic, when architecture had long been accustomed 
to hollow out interior space to the utm<h't and to make the pillars slender almost 
to breaking point, did the massive wooden wall begin I<> dissolve into a lighter 
framework, The fifteenth century carried the process further, Then furniture 
was treated as a skeleton, like the frame of a house, The massive plank walls 
broke down into a system of horizontal ties and vertical supports, Assembled 
according to carpenters' practice, their joints were carefully dovetailed, As 
in house construction, light, non-supporting panels were readily inserted into 
the frame in lieu of the wooden wall (fig, 150), 
Late Gothic frame construction grew organically from tl>e properties of wood, 
It allows for swelling and for shrinking, It is as vital to the development of 
Ia ler furniture types as is the sustained development of the cross-ribbed vault 
in architecture - a flight from massiveness toward refinement of form, 
In detail, frame construction underwent many change .. .:.;. New techniques 
appeared, but this late Gothic construction has remained until the present day 
as the method of building furniture, Not until recent decades was a new prin­
ciple advanced, whose supporting element was the elastic slab of plywood or 
plastic, 
Looking backwards, it would seem that time after time man forgets what he 
has once acquired, Frame e,onstruction, the drawer, and things for which the 
time was still to come - such as veneer or tbe gracefulness of Greek chairs -
all these had forn>ed part of everyday life in Antiquity, By arduous detours, 
the fifteenth century partially rediscovered them and used them in shaping 
intimate surroundings, 
Movability in Gothic Furniture 
Despite the crude execution and technique of medieval construction, efforts 
were not lacking to endow furniture with a degree of mobility, 
Far from neglecting the mobility of furniture, the Middle Ages often build 
collapsible furniture such as faldstools, iron lecterns, or trussing beds, In the 
late Gothic, furniture is made mobile to assist special activities, such as reading, 
writing, or painting, 
The simple mechanical means to these ends are the pivot and the hinge, 
The Pivot 
Before four-legged chairs came into use, the Middle Ages had movable chairs: 
collapsible seats or faldstools, These are simpler to make than the stable type, 
for essentially they consist of little beyond four members crossed x-wise, con­
nected by a length of cloth or leather, while a pair of stretchers aid stability,
