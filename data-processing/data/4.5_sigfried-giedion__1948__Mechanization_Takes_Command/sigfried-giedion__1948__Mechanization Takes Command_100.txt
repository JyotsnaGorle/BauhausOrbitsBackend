of groups, teamwork. This is achieved by the division of labor, which Adam 
Smith in the eighteenth century recognized as the basis of all industry, into

4,7, J. G. BODMER: First 
Traveling Grate for Boilers, Brit­
ish Patent, 1834. This Swiss 
engineer, active in England during 
the 1830's, brought new method..'> to 
the manufacture of machine tools 
and complicated machines; he is 
said to be an inventor of the VIler­
head traveling crane. We have no 
view of his machine slwp at Man­
chester, but detailed patent specifi­
cations exist. Like Evam, Bodmer 
was preoccupied with the endless 
belt, u.sing it to carry heavier ma­
terial and for new purposes. Jlis 
fraveling grate made in articulated 
sections was for the continuous 
stoking of jurTUtCes.
