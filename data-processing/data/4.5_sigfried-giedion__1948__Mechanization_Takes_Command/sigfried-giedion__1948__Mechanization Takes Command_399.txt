230. Surrealist Interpretation of the l9th~Century Interior, Max Ernst, 1929. Peering from a glassed 
bookca.se, the woman with a hundred no-heads in the guise of a plmler bu.-;t startles a pensi1Je bystander. The 
stamped lion heads of the chairs are changed into agianl ape. (Max Ernst, La Femme 100 tCtes, Paris, 1929) 
France's orientalizing cushion furniture, England developed a plainer style, 
connected with the habits of club life, These black leather easy chairs and sofas 
were destined for groups of pipe-smoking men. From this furniture, direct lines 
lead to the reforms of William Morris and his followers and thence to the present 
day, The English also did not allow the upholsterer so free a hand in their 
comfortable seating for the drawing room or the bedroom, But our knowledge 
of this development is fragmentary. 
F'or a time it seemed that the Rococo wave that gripped France in the 'thirties 
promised more than a stylistic revivaL The chairs of the Rococo, molded to the 
human form were elaborated in the 'sixties with an originality that cannot be 
wholly ignored, The seats become broader, lower, and deeper. Various hybrid 
forms arise, designed for what is neither sitting nor lying, They have one point 
in common: the invitation to informal posture, We shall see how truly this non­
static, changing posture corresponds to the character of the century, 
Describing this furniture, a writer in whom the Ancien Regime still lives on, 
as in so many Frenchmen, cannot repress the comment as he surveys the various 
species of conforlables, 'On entering our salons these days (1373) one involun­
tarily asks oneself whether these women, these men, so nonchalantly reclining 
and sprawled, mn he the descendants of that French societe once outstanding 
00 
for its brilliancy, its deportment and its savoir-vivre,' '
