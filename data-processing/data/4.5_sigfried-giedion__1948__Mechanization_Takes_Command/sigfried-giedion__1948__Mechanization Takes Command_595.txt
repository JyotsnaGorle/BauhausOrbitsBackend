The Mechanization of Cleaning: The Vacumn Cleaner 
The word 'vacuum cleaner' did not come into use before the beginning of 
our century, probably in 1903.U' The nineteenth century speaks only of 'car­
pet sweepers.' 
At the turn of the century, heterogeneously named firms appeared in America, 
claiming to have solved by air suction the problems of mechanical cleaning. 
'Air Cleaning Company,' one enterprise called itself, after the medium used. 
Another's title, 'Sanitary Devices Company,' stresses the hygienic aspect 
(elimination of flying dust). Finally a firm that acquired all the then basic 
119 
pat.errts assumed the name that was later to stand for the whole category: 
'Vacuum Cleaner Company.'

THE EARLY PORTABLE MACHINES C. 1860 
Toward the end of the 'fifties proposals were made to relieve hack-bending by 
means of devices to he rolled over the carpet at the end of a handle. Five carpet­
sweeping patents were granted in 1858, nine in 1859. These patents laid down 
the basic types. The solutions center around the idea of a cylindrical revolving 
us The Oxford English Dictionary quotes from the Westminster Gazette of 30 May 1903, showing how un­
familiar was the idea of cleaning by a void: 'There is a machine at work, called the vacuum cleaner.' 
The French speak at that time of a 'nettoyage sanitaire par le vide' (La Nature, Paris 1903, p.576).
