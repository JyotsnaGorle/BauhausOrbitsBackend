of three cigar-shaped balloons harnessed together like dogs. 'The discover~ 
made by Dr. Andrews,' if we arc to believe the prospectus, 'was simply this: 
that the attraction of gravity is a sufficient motor for navigation.' One need only 
49 
know how to exploit it correctly . On the other side of the ocean, there was no 
lack of similar plans for harnessing the aerial halloon. A halloon railway to the 
summit of Mt. Higi, Switzerland, was projected (1859) (fig. 95); its gas bag was 
expected to hoist a ear, suspended from an overhead rail, up the mountainside. 5° 
The period nlso took apprcciahle interest in the use of steam pressure to pre­
serve milk and fruits. Charles Alden was famous in his day for his experiments 
in drying and preserving fruit, tomatoes, and milk hy a steam process. 'The 
pneumatic evaporator reduces the whole pulp of the tomato to a condition like 
51 
that of the dried fig.' The early 'fifties also saw Gail Borden's experiments in 
condensing mille liZ 
Although soda water had been corrnnercially produced by a Geneva pharmacist 
in the late eighteenth century (1788), its general use did not begin until around 
1850, and in America only at the time of the Civil War. Its first application 
was chiefly for medicinal purposes and as mineral water. England issued 17 
patents between 1840 and 1350, but the French were unquestionably in the 
lead; though far less given to patents than the English, they registered 34 
'appareils a faire des eaux gaseuses' from 1344 to 1851. Toward mid-century, 
a Frenchman put on the market the present form of snda siphon, with the 'pewter 
53 
collar having a turn of screw on it.' 
Baking powder came into general use during the same period. In 1836, 
Dr. John Whiting, a reader of Justus Liebig's chemical writings, patented his 
method for 'preparing certain farinacious food.' " This first ehemical baking 
55 
powder for raising dough dirl not become popular until the 'fifties. Contem­
porary advertising, in which the biscuits are pictured as nailed down so as not 
to fly away while baking (fig. 98), indicates that even in the 'sixties the gas­
producing powder was still something of a novelty. 
A great contemporary was moving along lines similar to John Dauglish's, to 
obtain more rapid and eheaper production by means of gases and pressure: in 
1856 Henry Bessemer first announced his method of steel production that was
