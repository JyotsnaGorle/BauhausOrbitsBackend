Pressing, stamping, casting result in stam!ardization and, closely connected 
therewith, the interchangeability of parts. Of the early beginnings some facts 
and fragments are generally known. Eli Whitney, inventor of the cotton gin, 
is held the first to have introduced interchangeability of parts in gun manufac­
ture at his Whitneyville factory; Simeon North, the pistol maker who had his 
workshop in near-by Middletown (Conn.), worked on the same principle. That 
is, the idea was in the air. In France, Thomas Jefferson in an often-quoted 
letter observed that a mechanic was manufacturing guns from interchangeable 
parts (1782). We have but scanty knowledge, however, about what late eight­
eenth-century France accomplished in this sphere, and systematic research 
is still needed. The machines that Brunei invented or combined with existing 
ones for the production of pulley hlocks based on standardization and inter­
changeability are descrihed and illustrated in full detail in the early nineteenth­
editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
