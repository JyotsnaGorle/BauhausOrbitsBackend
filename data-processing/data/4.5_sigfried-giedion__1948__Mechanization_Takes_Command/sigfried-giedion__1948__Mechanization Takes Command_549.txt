clear indications that we are in the pre-business period. But Stewart soon left 
Oberlin and moved to Troy, where in thirty years he manufactured some 90,000 
stoves. 
Philo Stewart's Oberlin Stove, it is generally recognized, formed the startingÂ­
point for the technified range. Then begins the time of specialists and technical 
improvements. By around 1840 the cast-iron cooking stove was a vigorously 
plastic type, having a base and superstructure. It drew the same interest in 
its time as the streamline-kitchen a century later. As in other fields, the most 
active period of invention was from the middle 'fifties down to the 'seventies. 
An advertisement of 1848 charmingly shows the manifold possibilities then 
available: combined coal and wood ftring, movable grates, storage space 
(fig. 358). 
The uninsulated vertical copper boiler combined with the range came into 
use during the 'seventies (fig. 360).
