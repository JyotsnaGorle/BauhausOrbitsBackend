341. Continuous Working Surfaces: J. J.P. Oud, L-Shaped Kitchen, WeissenhofSettlement, Stuttgart, 
1927. J. J. P. Oud, who carefully planrred large flats for u;orkers in Holland before 1920, brought his skill to 
the L-shaped kitchen of row lw!U5es at the Weissenlwf experimental settlement. Although this low-cost kitchen 
seems to have little in common with the while-enameled, mechanized kitchen of 1940, its organization embodied 
alnwsl everything the manufacturers were later to offer in luxuriOus versions.
