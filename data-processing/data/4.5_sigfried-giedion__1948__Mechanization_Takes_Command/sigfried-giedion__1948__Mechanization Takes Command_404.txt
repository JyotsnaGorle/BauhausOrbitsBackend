terested in the special use their chair was to serve; they :;imply wished to con­
trive a new mechanism, such as a seat that would incline and be fixed back­
ward or forward. And so the American Patent Office would introduce a new 
category, such as 'tilting chairs.' Abundant as the solutions were, this problem 
of motion was by no means simple. European furniture about 1920 likewise 
sought to adapt to the contours of the human budy. But there dissection into 
separate planes fell short in almost every attempt. The sitter stays anchored 
in the unvarying position of the frame of these pieces; he is not carried back -
as in the American office chair or barber's chair -from the reclining position 
to the normal, which permits him to rise without effort.

In the four decades from 1350 to 1390 no activity of everyday life was taken 
for granted. An unbridled inventive urge shaped everything anew. Furniture, 
like other things, underwent transformation. This called for an independence 
of feeling and a courage to see with new and untried eyes. These very qualities 
made the nation's vigor at that stage. No conventions cramp the combinatory 
faculties, whether the anonymous inventors develop types for new purposes or 
whether they endow existing types with an undreamed of convertibility and 
mobility. 
The America that exhibited at the international expositions between 1351 and 
1889 was not ashamed of its non-'artistic' furniture, which, seen beside the
