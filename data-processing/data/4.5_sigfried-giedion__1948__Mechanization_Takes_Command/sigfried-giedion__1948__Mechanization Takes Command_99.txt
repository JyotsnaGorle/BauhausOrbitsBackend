matters is the power of his vision. From this standpoint, Oliver Evans' invention 
opeus a new chapter in the history of mankind. 
The Beginnings of the Assembly Line 
Oliver Evans disassembled a complex material (grain), mechanically fabricat­
ing a new product therefrom (flour). In the nineteenth century also the problem 
was to fabricate a product mechanically - a machine for instance. Here the 
parts are 'assembled' and combined into a new whole. But this is no rule. 
A whole is often disassembled into its parts as in Evans' mill (in mechanized 
slaughtering for instance). What marks this period is the unperfected state 
of the machinery. Men had to he inserted in the mechanisms, as it were, to 
eusure an uninterrupted production line. 
The assembly line fonns the backbone of manufacture in our time. The 
problems involved are no less deeply human than they are organizational and 
technical. Its slow growth is imperfectly known. In what follows, we shall take 
at random only a few cross sections from the nineteenth century. 
From the nineteenth century on, the assembly line, beyond its labor-saving 
mechanisms, consists first and foremost in the rationally plrumed co-operation
