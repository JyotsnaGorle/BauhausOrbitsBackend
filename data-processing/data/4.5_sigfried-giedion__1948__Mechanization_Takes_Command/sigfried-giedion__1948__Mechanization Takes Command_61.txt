As mechanizal.ion advanced, stamping,

The engraling of the Hydraulic Press, is to give the reader some idea of the method of construe• 
tion., Sheets of G~lvanized Iron are laid between the enormous dies, grooved to fit each other, one• 
of which re">ts upon the Cylinder, and which when brought together- by the Hydraulic Pressure of 
tight hundred tons, corrugates the Iron, "Which gives it gteat strength, and at the same time the shape 
nnd curve of the Boat; the sheets -are then _riveted together, and fini3hed with the usual gunwale, &c., 
by Peter Barlow, 1836. Dies become of growing importance: from the stamping 
of coins (fig. 200) to the pres.,ing of metal lifeboat halves, achieved around 1850 
(fig. 23). 'Sheets of galvanized iron are laid between enormous dies, grooved 
to fit each other.' This procedure was not exploited on a grand seale until the 
time of full mechanization, in the automobile industry. Side by side with the 
differentiation and reshaping of age-old tools, a simultaneous transformation
