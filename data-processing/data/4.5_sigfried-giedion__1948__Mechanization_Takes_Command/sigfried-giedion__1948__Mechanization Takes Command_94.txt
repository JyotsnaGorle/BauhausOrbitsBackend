44. OLIVER EVANS: Archh~edean Screws and Bucket Conveyor for Elevating 
and Transporting Grain. 1783. Inventor of the production line, Evans uses the Arcbi­
medean screw within a !fYSlem of belt and bucket conveyors, to nwve the material (grain) 
from pNJCess to process unaided by ihe human hand. 'An end~s .~crew of two continued 
spire;;' moves the grain lwrizonlally. The 'elevator jOI" raisinq vertically' is an endless 
beUof sheet-iron buckets (CD). The descender (EF) is' a broad endless strap of very thin 81 
pliant leather, carnw or flannel N!fJOlvin.g over two pulJeys. . . • The grain by its own 
gravity sets iM machine in rrwiion. This machine moves on the principle of an overshot 
water wheel.' (Evans, Young Millwright and Miller's Guide, 1795)
