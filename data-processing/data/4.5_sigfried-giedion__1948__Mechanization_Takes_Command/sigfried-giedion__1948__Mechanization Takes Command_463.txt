285 a, b. Woodruff's 'Seat and Couch for Railway Cars': Basic Solution for t.he Upper Berth, 1856. 
Second of the basic sleeping-car patents, the 'Seat and Couch for Railway Car' (abmoe) and 'Improvement 
in Railroad Car Seals and Couches' (below) of Throdore T. Woodruff, most fertile inventor in lhi.sjield, offered 
the principle that has rwl been abandoned in America. Anyone curious for the details may peruse Woodruff's 
lucid specifications. The main principle of patent furniture consists in ezlending the law of lransmutabili.iy 
of plane surfaces. Seals, backs, wall surfaces, all are articulated; nothing irt hard and fast. Like his prede­
cessors, Woodruff folds the seats down to floor level, The topmost bed- the fifth -embodies the decisive solu­
tion: when not in u.~e it swings up, bridging the angle of roof and wall. This idea was taken over by Pullman 
in the famous 'Pioneer' of 1865 {ff!l. 286). The difference between these two patents of Woodruff's, botlt sub­
milled on ihe same day, is that the one (above) dUsecfs the upper bed into four parts (ll'{iculat.ed in pairs, whereas 
the other (below) swings the bed up bodily, as is still done in the Pullman car. (U. S. Patents 16,159 and 
16,160, 2 December 1856)
