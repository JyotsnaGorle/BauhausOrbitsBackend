- something which is transmitted from one generation to the next. A momenÂ­
tous responsibility is involved. 
Seen in this perspective, the short-lived demands of the market take on a 
grotesque aspect. Before the Second World War, because of the competition of 
vegetable oils, pigs were hred for a minimum of fat; a few years later outside 
circumstances demanded a complete reversal of these characteristics. Instances 
like these show up the weakness of day-to-day expediency. A different attitude 
is necessary, as for instance that which guided the research center of Animal 
Industry at Beltsville, Md.," in adapting pigs to the southern climate. Here 
the advantages of light-colored north European pigs- long pink hodies, good 
hams-- were combined with the essential features of the American breed. The 
pink-skinned varieties were unable to withstand the sun of the southern states. 
In a few years, by cross-breeding, a darker-hued, red, hlack, or spotted pig was 
developed that satisfied all requirements. 
H The Beltsville Research Center, attached to the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, is located l;i miles from 
Washington, D.C. Beginning with 475 acres in 1910, it has expanded to 13,900 acres, with two thousand 
employees. It is mainly concerned with the improvement of plants and livestock, and the control of 
insect pests. Messrs. R. W. Phillips, John H. Zeller, and T. C. Byerly kindly allowed us access to the 
center and put their knowledge at our disposal.
