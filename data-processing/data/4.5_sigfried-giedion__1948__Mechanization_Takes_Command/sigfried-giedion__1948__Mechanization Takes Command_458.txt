277. Railroad Seats Convertible into Couches, 1858. This composite sketch, comprising twv of the irwen足
lor's patent drawinqs, shows an e[forl in 1858 lo transform the railroad smf info a couch without pre-empting 
extra space, The inventor's plan. was to hoist e11ery second bench ceilingward, af!.er which both benches would

on which he might stretch out. Another suggested 'constructing every alter足
nate seat in two distinct part:-;'- one, the frame, remaining fixed; the other 
being raised on guiding columns or posts. 'In this manner the seats are enabled 
to be converted into comfortable double sleeping couches situated upon hori足
zontal planes at different elevations, the hacks of the several seats being thrown 
hack and sustained , , , to effect this result.' Thus the passengers would sleep

seats as, Jater on, barbers' chairs or dentists' chairs came to be designed: wilh 
adjustable headrests, hinged hacks, and swing footrests. One- as early as 
1855 ---mounted his swivel seat on a clamping disk carried hy a post. It could

aimed at mobility by a system of slotted hemicircles and thumbscrews, while

he slid out the leg rest telescopically (fig. 276). A third balanced his seat on 
53 
an 'oscillating pedestaL' A fourth constructed his with swinging footrests, 
adjustable back, and headrest regulated hy helical springs "" (fig. 273). These 
complicated devices also were adapted to barbers' chairs, but not until decades 
later (fig. 279). A simplified form of this type of armchair with extensible foot足
