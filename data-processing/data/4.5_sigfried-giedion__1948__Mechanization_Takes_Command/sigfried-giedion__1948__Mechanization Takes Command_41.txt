Movement, the ceaselessly changing, proves itself ever more strongly the 
key to our thought. It underlies the concept of function and of variables in 
higher mathematics. And in physics, the essence of the phenomenal world has 
been increasingly regarded as motion-process: sound, light, heat, hydrodynamics, 
aerodynamics; until, in this century, matter too dissolves into motion, and 
physicists recognize that their atoms consist of a kernel, a nucleus, around which 
negatively charged electrons circle in orbits with a speed exceeding that of the 
planets. 
A parallel phenomenon occurs in philosophy and literature. Ahnost simul­
taneously with Lumiere's cinematograph (1895-6), Henri Bergson was lecturing 
to the College de France on the 'Cinematographic Mechanism of Thought' 
15 
(1900) And later James Joyce split words open like oysters, showing them in 
motion.
