365. Electric Kitchen, Columbian Exhibition, Chi('.ago, 1893. The Columbian exhibition of 1893 put on 
an unprecedented display of electrical illumination. The application of eleclricity to household appliances 
was demonstrated in lhe first electric kitchen. Eaeh saucepan, water healer, broiler, or boiler was connected to 
an individual outlet, a principle that was revived in the kitchen of the 1940's (fig. 436a, b). 
contemporary handbook states, 'electric range manufacturers had developed 
57 
the most perfect cooking device in the world.' 
Various producers of electricity were now delivering current for cooking at 
a low price, and the network was spreading. The electric range was recognized 
as a large consumer of current, and modern sales organizations grew up in 
America to apply the necessary stimulus. They were later imitated in most 
electricity-producing countries.
