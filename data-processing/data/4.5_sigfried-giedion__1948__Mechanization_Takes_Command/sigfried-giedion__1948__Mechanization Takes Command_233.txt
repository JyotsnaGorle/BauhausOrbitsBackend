110. Swift's First Successful 
Storage Refrigerator. New 
York, 1882. After twenly years 
of failure, Gustavus Swift suc­
ceeded by careful planning in 
bringing chilled meal fo the mar­
kets of a distant metropolis. 
' The new departure depressed 
the market by three to jour 
dollars the hundredweight. • 
(Harper's Weekly, 21 October 
-- 1882) 
a more intensive widening of the railroad network began. 'It was in 1849 that 
the whistle of the locomotive was first heard on the prairies west of Chicago,' 
if only over a ten-mile stretch.'' In 1850 a portion of the northwestern prairie 
in the State of Illinois as far as Galena was also hronght in. In the 'sixties 
repeated spanning of the entire continent was successful. At the beginning of 
the 'seventies, the Chicagoans boasted of a train leaving every fifteen minutes." 
In the same decade, the competing lines grew so powerful that a debacle ensued, 
with open warfare against the railroad companies. 
During the 'fifties, to escape the drawbacks of seasonal operation, summer 
slaughtering was introduced so far as was then possible in Chicago. This called 
for capacious, cool storehouses stocked with natural ice. Soon these wooden 
constructions appeared in every town where packing was carried on. In the 
early 'seventies, gradually began the introduction of refrigeration by artificial 
means. 
The final overthrow of the local supply system came about only with the 
27 
introduction of the refrigerator car. The experimental period extended over 
fifteen years, 1867-82: from the first granting of an American patent in 1867, 
and from the moving of the first shipments between Chicago and Boston, to 
the decisive success of the marketing of slaughtered carcasses in New York.
