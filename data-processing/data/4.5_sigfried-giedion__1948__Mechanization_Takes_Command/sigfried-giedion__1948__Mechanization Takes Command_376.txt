The artist fuses these childhood memories into a mirror to morality. But 
there are many people for whom nineteenth-century ruling taste still forms the 
well of feeling, and in whose souls, as T. S. Eliot once put it, the nineteenth 
century lingers on into the twentieth. Still among these are most of our con­
temporaries, in particular the men whose taste determines public. buildings and 
monuments. For most of these, the origin of their esthetic faith has never come 
to consciousness. i"" 
Do not Carlyle's lines written toward mid-century in his restive Latter-Day 
Pamphlets seem to echo a caption for Max Ernst? 
The fact is ... the Fine Arts, divorced entirely from truth this long wl:Ule, and wedded 
almost professedly to falsehood, fiction and such-like, are got what we must call, an 
insane condition: they walk abroad without keepers, nobody suspecting their bad state~ 
and do fantastic tricks. 55
