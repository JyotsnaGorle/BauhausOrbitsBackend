remains primitive: boxes of massive timbers secured by broad-headed nails. 
Chests were developed in diverse shapes and sizes, and for many purposes. 
They were treated in a variety of ways: covered with leather, bound with iron 
bands or with wrought-iron scrollwork, painted, carved, inlaid with intarsia, or 
embellished with polychrome plaster reliefs. 
Chests are the universal furniture of the Middle Ages. They stand in every 
room, sometimes to the wall, sometimes by the side or at the foot of the bed. 
Often chests of uniform size are arranged lengthwise, end to end along the walls. 
They are found in the North and in the South: they stand in the upper Rhenish 
interior, where Mary is bathing the Child (c.1450) (fig. 141), in the study where 
Polyphilo writes the letter to his beloved (1499) (fig. 142), and in the bedroom 
where his lady reads it. Normally chests were plain standardi1.ed containers 
without claim to individuality. Such easily transportable pieces were purchased 
as the need arose. 
Well into the sixteenth century, elothes were not hung, but laid away hori­
zontally. By the serial chests of the Middle Ages we may gange the austerity 
of everyday life. 
Chests arranged end to end along the walls were increasingly displaced around 
1500 by the continuous bench skirting the whole circumference of the room.
