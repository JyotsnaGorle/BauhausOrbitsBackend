in the fifteenth century at least, was not given over solely to writing, sleeping, 
or dining; it served at the same time as a container. Hence the chest-bench or 
settle, the box-chair, and the hutch-table. These types started from the chest: 
the universal furniture and universal receptacle of the Middle Ages.

on a low plinth - features clearly carried over from the choir stall.
