swing-har hench of the fifteenth century (fig. 153), allowed the sitter to have either 
face or hack to the fire. The swing hacks found today on American trains and 
streetcars derive from this simple rail of the 'forties, which at the same time 
opened the way for the future mobility of the railroad seat. Soon afterward, the 
'fifties were to develop in rapid sequence whole series of solutions, often fantastic.

Starting from the swing back, the e11rliest patents (1351) contemplated. 
means of setting the hack rest for height as well as for inclination. It became 
adjustable, for example by 'an arrangement of two levers in a cross position,' 
51 
and was secured 'firmly in its position at any required angle' (fig. 274). 
Thence grew the desire to huild seats that could he adapted for day or night 
traveling hy the device of a back rest whose front and rear followed different 
curves. In its normal position, for day travel, the convex side supported the 
spine, while at night the conc2ve side supported the head and shoulders - 'the 
outside turned inside ... at the same time raised high enough to support the 
52 
head and hody equally well for nightriding.' A small advertisement for this 
patent has hy chance hcen preserved, clearly illustrating the adaptation of the 
day and night positions (fig. 272). 
Comfort was to he attained, whether hy complicated mechanisms or hy simple 
devices like the 'railroad rest' (1857) that the passenger brought with him and 
hooked on (fig. 273). Soon another problem moved rapidly to the fore, and 
attention turned to the convertible armchair. What had originally heen invented 
for invalid chairs was now to be transplanted to every railroad seat. 
To"ard the close of the 'fifties, inventors seemed possessed with the idea that 
the railroad seat, within its narrow space, must he made as comfortable, as 
adjustable, as convertible as was humanly possible. Not satisfied 'to adjust 
the seat to any position required,' " they were ambitious to make 'the seats 
... adjustable for night travel so as to form a comfortable berth,' " that is, to 
transform seats into beds with no loss in mnnhers. It wa8 like squaring the 
circle, and proved insoluble. But there is something appealing in these often 
freakish ideas: a desire to find the democratic solution that will allow everybody 
to enjoy an equal share of comfort. 
Everyone was entitled to a hed. One inventor proposed a 'swinging frame,' 
which would be upright and reach the ceiling during the day, and which at night 
could be lowered like a drawbridge to offer the traveler a slightly inclined plane
