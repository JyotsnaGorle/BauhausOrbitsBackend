242. Posture in the Early 
Nineteenth Century: Por~ 
trait of Empress Josephine, 
Water color by Bonington 
after GCrard. Even before 
1310 there is a noticeable 
gap between posture and fur­
niture. The lady is sitting 
diagonally on the rigid Em­
pire piece. Informality is the 
keynote. (Andrew Shirley, 
Bonington, London, 1941) 
243. Sofa or Machine for the 
Care of Invalids, 1813. Fur­
niture suitable lo the informal 
posture between silting and 
lying was first used by the 
sick. Hence its adaptability. 
The late eighteenth century de­
vised 'bed-machines' with the 
71U1liress segmented inio lh.:tee 
planes, which in the first dec­
ades of the nineteenth century 
were raU!ed a1 various angles by 
means of a cumber.~ome .~ystem 
of winches, worms, and gf_.ars.

after 1840. 'An invalid 
couch, contrived to raise the

form W the situation of the legs

by means of a winch.' Even

gave consideration lo adjustable 
couches at this period,
