which are infinite in their capacities and forbid all general rules.' 
The range is based on the concentrating of the heat source within a reduced 
space, and all the skills of a scientific century were needed to channel the 
heat effectively and overcome the range's drawbacks. Thermal efficiency lay 
beyond the craftsman's scope. It was a matter for the physicist. The steam 
boiler and the cast-iron range have a common prerequisite: the efficient utiliza­
tion of heat by the correct channeling of combustion gases. Understandably 
then, the men who guided the development of the range were rarely stove 
makers by training. 
Benjamin Franklin built no kitchen range, but had designed before mid­
eighteenth century a stove to be placed in the frreplaee, for utilization of the 
unexhausted combustion gases. In France especially, as Franklin himself 
admits," attempts had already been made to improve the thermal efficiency of

fireplaces. Franklin's 'Pennsylvania Fireplace' of 1742 (fig. 347),' although 
it met with no favor in its own day, has remained the most famous of such 
efforts. Franklin also found suggestions in the 'Dutch Stove,' which was wide-
