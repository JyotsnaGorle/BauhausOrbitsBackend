THE HAMMOCK: INDIAN FURNITURE 
The hammock, with its airy network and continuous ventilation, arose in a 
tropical climate. It belongs among the rare furniture whose home is America, 
or, more exactly, the Caribbean region. 
Christopher Columbus saw it in 1492 on his first voyage to the Bahamas. 
The rareful account that Las Casas copied from Columbus' manuscript clearly 
reflects the novelty of this first impression." 
The watering party visited several native houses, and reported that 'their 
heds and furnishings were like nets of cotton.' 'These,' comments Las Casas, 
are in Hispaniola called hamacas, which are in the form of slings, not woven like nets 
with the threads going zig-zag, but the lengthwise threads are so loose that you can insert 
the hand and fingers, and at a hand's breadth more or less they are crossed with other 
gn U.S. Patent 33,678, 5 Nov. 1861, Improved Hammock. This patent merely covers a conventional 
hammock in connt'.ction with a 'portable folding frame.' The second patent (U.S. Patent 68,927, 17 Sept. 
1867), of English origin, would replace the net by collapsible boards.
