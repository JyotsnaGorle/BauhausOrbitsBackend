Frank W. Gilbreth, the master of motion studies, who probed so deeply the 
nature of manual activity, stresses once again in his last essay, A Fourth DimenÂ­
sion for Measuring Skill (1924), that no movement can exactly repeat another. 
The hand can be trained to a degree of automatic facility. But one power is 
denied it: to remain unvaryingly active. It must always he grasping, holding, 
manipulating. It cannot continue a movement in endless rotation. That is 
precisely what mechanization entails: endless rotation. The difference between 
walking aud rolling, between the legs and the wheel, is basic to all mechanization. 
STANDARDIZATION AND INTERCHANGEABILITY 
THE first phase of mechanization consists in transforming the pushing, pulling, 
pressing of the hand into continuous rotation. The second phase concerns the 
means of mechanization: By what procedures are objects to be mechanically 
reproduced? As early as the first decades of the nineteenth century, mechanical 
reproduction was effectuated in diverse ways, by stamping, pressing, embossing, 
and other methods, as described, for instance, by Charles Babbage, 1832, or
