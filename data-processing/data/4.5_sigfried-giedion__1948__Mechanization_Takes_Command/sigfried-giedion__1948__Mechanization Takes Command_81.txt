39. Iron Key, Ptolemaic Period. 5!- inches long. From 
Lord Carnarvon'.~ excavations at Drah abu'l Negga, 
Thebes. Yale's lock cannot !wve been derived from the 
SfHalled Egyptian lock, as i.~ generally believed. This 
complicated key shape stems from the highly technical 
Ptolemaic period- third or second century B.C. It 
more clo..~ely resembles Greek than Egyptian ancestors.

40. Sycamore Wood Lock, c.A.D. 800, from the 
Monastery of Epiphanius, at Thebes. Over a thousand 
years after the Ptolemaic example, !he lock's principle 
is unchanged. In neither case are the tumblers aligned 
in the direction of insertion of the key, as in the wooden 
key type of the Faroe .Islanders or Penn$y{vania Dutch, 
wlw use an altogether differently shaped key. 
41. Wooden Two~tumbler Lock, Faroe 
Islands. Profile and section. Its two tum足
ble" (d,d) fall info lwles (f,f) of the bolt 
(a) to block the mechanism, as in lhe Penn~ 
sylvania Dutch lock (opposite, lop). The 
two locks differ but slightly: the Penn.~yl足

blers; the Faroe lock passes its key (b,b,c) 
through a groove higher in the lock. (Pitt足
