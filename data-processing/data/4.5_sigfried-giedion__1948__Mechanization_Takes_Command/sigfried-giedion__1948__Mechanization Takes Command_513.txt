Breuer's pioneering impulse in tubular chairs was soon followed by French 
contributious. It is significant bow often problems of mobility appear in the 
French models; not virtuosity in conveying motion by mechanical systems as 
in American patent furniture; but the use of simple means such as hinges or 
pivots. Well marked, however, was the effort to bring European furniture out

Charlotte Perriand, the young French architect, began her work io LeCor足

to the boudoir without straying into the merely decorative. She succeeded by
