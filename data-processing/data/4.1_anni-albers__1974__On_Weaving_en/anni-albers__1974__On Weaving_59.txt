Interrelation of Fiber and Construction 
EvERY fabric is mainly the result of two elements: the character of the fibers 
used in the thread construction, that is, the building material, and the con­
struction, or wcnvc, itself. The illlcrmedi:•te step of spinning the fi bers into 
thread also plays a part in determining the product, as docs the "finishing" of 
the fabric, which is gaining increasing importance today. But the dom inant 
conditioning factors are, perhaps not for so very much longer, the character 
of the raw material and that of the weave. 
The fibers, wh ich are the 1·aw material, may be soft and spun into a soft 
thread and still may be turned into a stilT material as a result of the weave. 
Or the weave may make for pliability dc~pite a non-pliant fiber or a hard­
spun thread, to give some exa mples of counteraction. The important fact 
implied is the inAuence of one upon the other, the modulation each under­
goes through the agency of the other, the tuning up or down of some inherent 
qualities, or their alteration. For instance, the traits of linen, a somewhat 
hard and very swrdy fiber, will be underlined in a plain weave, which tend~ 
lO produce a somewhat stiff and very firm fabric. In fact, the two correspond 
so well that the plain weave is a lso called the linen weave. Cotton, more 
common than linen and used in manifold ways, becomes in a plain weave 
one of the most useful and verslltile materials we have. Less out~poken in 
character than linen, softer, fuzzier, Jess moisture-absorbent, more dust­
catching- to name a few of its qua lities - <.:Otton is, like any Jess clear-cut 
character, all the more adaptable. Wool in a plain weave loses some of its dis­
tinction. The main advantages of wool, its vinues as a good insulator and 
1hus sought for warmth, are uot sHpponed iu a construction that docs not al -
