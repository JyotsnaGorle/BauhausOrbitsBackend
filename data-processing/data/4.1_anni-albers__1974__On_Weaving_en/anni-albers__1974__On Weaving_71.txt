Designing as Visual Organization 
IT is safe, I suppose, to <1~sume th <lt today most if not all of us have had the 
experience of looking down from an airplane onto this earth. What we see is 
a free flow of forms intersected here and there by straight lines, rectangles, 
circles, nnd evenly drawn curves; th<~t is, by shapes of great regul<~rity. Here 
we have, then , natural and man.rnade forms in contr:tdistinction. Aud here 
we can rc~:ognizc the essence of designing, a visually comprehensible, 
before us 
simplified organization of forms that is distinct from nature's secretive and Plnll' ;9 
complex working. 
Or on a beach, we may find a button, a bottle, a plank of wood, imme­
diately recognizable as "our .. doing, belonging to our world of forms and not 
to that wh ich made the shells, the seaweed, and the undulated tracings of 
waves on sand. Also we can observe the counterplay of the forming forces: 
the sea slowly grinding au evenly walled piece of glass, foreign to it in shape 
nnd substance, into a multiform body sui table for adoption into its own or­
bit oE figuration. On the other hand, we see the waves controlled, where dams 
nnd dikes draw a rigid line between land and water. 
T o turn from "looking at" to action: we grow cabbages in stra ight rows 
and are not tempted hy nature's fanciful way of planting to scaner them 
about. W e may a1 ·gue that sometimes we fo llow her method <1nd plant a 
freely 
bush here and another there, but even then we "clear" the ground. Always, 
though sometimes in a wny that is roundabout and apparem only ns an un­
derlying scheme of composition, it is clarity that we seek. But when the mat­
er of usefulness is involved, we plainly and without qunlification use our 
t
characteristics: forms that, however far they may deviate in their final de· 
velopment, are intrinsically geometric.
