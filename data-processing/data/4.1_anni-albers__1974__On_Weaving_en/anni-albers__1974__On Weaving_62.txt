Tactile Sensibility 
ALL pro)!;rcs-'>, ~o it seems, is coupled w re~Te~~ion elsewhere. We have ad­
vanced in gcnerill, for instance, in regard tO verbal ilrticulation- the reading 
and writing public of today is enormous. Bm we certa inly have gTown in­
crea~ing-ly insensitive in our pen:eption by touch, the tauilc sense. 
No wonder a faculty that i~ so largely unemployed in our daily plodding 
and hustling is degenerating. Our malCriab come to us already ground and 
chipped and rrushed and powdered and mixed and sliced, so that only the fi­

saves us endlt:ss labor and druclp;ery; but, .Janus-faced, it also h:~1·s us from 
taking part in the forming of material and leaves idle our sense ol touch and 
with it those formative facultic~ that arc ~timulated by it. 
We touch things to :1ssure ourselves of reality. We touch the objects o[ 
our love. We touch the things we form. Our tactile experiences arc elclllen­
tal. lf we reduce their range, as we do when we reduce the necessity to form 
things ourselves, we grow lopsided. We are apt today to overcharge our gray 
matter wi th words and pictures, that is, with material al ready transposed into 
a certain key, preformu latcd material, and to fall short in prov iding fo r a
