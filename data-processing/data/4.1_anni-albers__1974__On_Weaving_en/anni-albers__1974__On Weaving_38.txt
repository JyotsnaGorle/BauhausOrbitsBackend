C HAPTER THREE 
The Fundamental Constructions 
Tm: structure of a fabric or its weave- tl1at is, the fastening of it~ elements 
of threads to each other - is as much a determining factor in its function as 
is the choice of the raw material. In fact, the interrelation of the two, the 
subtle play between them in supporting, impeding, or modifying each other's 
characteristics, is the essence of weaving. 
T he fundamental constructions, in common with all fundamental proc­
esses, have a universal character and arc used today, as they were in our early 
history, here and everywhere. They show the principle of textile construction 
dearly. With only a few exceptions, all other constructions are elaborations 
or combinations of the basic three: the plain weave, the twill, and the satin 
weave. Of these three it is the plain weave that embodies the sum total of 
weaving ami therewith reaches back the furthest. 
All weaving is the interlacing of two distinct groups of threads at right 
angles. Wherever a fabric is formed in a different manner we are not dealing 
with a weaving. Where, for instance, t he threads intersect diagonally in re­
lation m the edge of tbe fabric, or radially from a center, we have a braided 
material: where only one tiH-e<ed is used to build up the material, we have ;1 
knitted or crocheted one; where threads intertwine or loop around each 
other, we have a lace or a net fabric. The horizontal-vertical intersecting of 
the two separate systems of thread is of great consequence for the formative 
side of weaving. The more clearly this original formation is preserved or 
stressed in the design, the stronger the weaving will be in those characteris­
cs that set it apart from other techniques. Just as a sculpture of stone that 
ti
contents itself to live within the limits of its stone nature is superior in formal
