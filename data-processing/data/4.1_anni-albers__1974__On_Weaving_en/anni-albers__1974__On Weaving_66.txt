TAPeSTRY weaving is a form of weaving that reaches back to the earliest be­
~innings of thread interlacing, is SLill with us roday, and may have a future 
noteworthy in its promise. Taken in its widest meaning. the term encompasses 
the various tcdmiques that can be used to mark off different areas of color 
and surface-treatment from each other in the woven plane. In a narrower 
sense the term refers to a ted111ique of weaving, or variation of it. where a 
weft thread, covering the warp completely, passes only ovt:r the surface of 
those sections of the weav ing th:u arc tO be built or iL The thread then in· 
terlocks at the horderlines, either with neighboring weft threads that meet it 
or with a warp thread, before turning back, after a change of shed, into its 
own field. 
It is a form of weaving that is pictorial in character, in contrast to pat· 
tern weaving, which deals with repeats of contrasting areas. It works with 
forms meaningful both in themselves and through their relatedness within 
the pictorial orga nization. The varifonn elements and their free placement 
within the limits of a given design demand the greatest possible freedom of 
the strucwral scheme; in fact, they demand such independence from mechani· 
:r.ation of the weaving process that hardly any of the time-saving inventions 
of the past hundreds or thousands of years of textile history can be utilized in 
lhis work. It is art work; and. as in other plastic arts, it demands the most di· 
rcct - that is, the leasl impeded - response of material and technique to the 
hand of the maker, the one who here u ansforms mauer into meaning. 
If we think o( a tapestry as an articulation in terms of forms made of 
threads, examples of such work go back to the earliest experiments in cloth
