.PREFACE
BY HILLA REBAY
Wassily Kandinslcy was born in Moscow, December 5, 1866. As a child,
he loved to paint. The effects of colours on him were deeply felt. The beauty
of the sunset over the cupolas of Moscow and the intensity of colour in
peasant art, contrasting with the grey vastness of his native country,
enlightened his vision. After terminating his law studies at the age of
thirty, he was offered a professorship. In refusing it, at this turning point
of his life, he made the decision to abandon a safe career and to leave
for Munich to study painting. He later recalled this decision as "putting
a final period to long studies of preceding years."
After two years of painting in Munich, he was admitted to the Royal
Academy where studied under Franz von Stuck. This instruction, how-
he
ever, did not satisfy him and in 1902 he opened his own art school, which
closed two years later when he undertook four-year series of travels
a to
France, Italy, Tunisia, Belgium, and Holland. Upon
his return to Munich,
one magical incident
evening there occurred at dusk the of his seeing
form
merely the and tone values in one of his paintings. While not recog-
nizing
its subject, he was not only struck by its increased beauty but also
by the superfluity of the object in painting, in order to feel its spell. It
took him fully two years to crystallize this miraculous discovery. Never-
theless, he still used objective inspiration in the paintings of this period,
but only as a structural element, while the organization of form and colour
values, used for the sake of composition, already dominated these ab-
stractions.
