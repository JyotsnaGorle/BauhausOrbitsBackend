points
of which we have already spoken, can be produced in music with
all sorts of instruments—especially the percussion instruments. The piano,
however, enables the creation of finished compositions exclusively by

The above music translated into points.
* It is clearly evident that certain musicians also have been more or less consciously
attracted by the magnetic power of the point, which can be distinctly recognized
through its inner tension as demonstrated by the so-called subconscious "hallucination"
of Bruckner, whose meaning had been detected and described: "How could this (his
interest in the effect of points after signatures or on doorplates) have been a derange-
ment of his spirit, when it seems that it was no wandering mind which investigated these
points—especially if one understands Bruckner's nature and the manner in which ho
searched for knowledge as indicated in his studies of the theory of music? It becomes
apparent
that psychological significance resides in the fact that he was attracted to
the
reclining proto-unit of all spatial expansion's origin. He sought everywhere for the
ultimate inner points, to reach this final analysis out of which, in his opinion, originates
the infinity of vast dimensions, impossible without its originating extension point."
