ticular character:
1. it is a geometric combined line, if the parts brought together are
exclusively geometric,
2. it is a mixed combined line, if free parts are associated with geo-
metric, and
3. it is a free combined line, if it composed entirely lines.

which expresses itself in tensions. The tensions, for their part, permit the
inner nature of the element to be expressed. An element is the objective
result of the action of the force on the material. The line is the clearest
and simplest case of this creative process which always takes place in
exact obedience to law and, therefore, allows and requires an exact law-
abiding application. Thus, a composition is nothing other than exact
an
law-abiding organization of the vital forces which, in the form of ten-
sions, are shut up within the elements.
Number In the final analysis, every force finds expression in number; this is called
numerical expression. In art at present, this remains a rather theoretic
contention but, nevertheless, it must not be left out of consideration. We
today lack the possibilities of measurement which some day, sooner or
later, will be found beyond the Utopian. From this moment on, it will
