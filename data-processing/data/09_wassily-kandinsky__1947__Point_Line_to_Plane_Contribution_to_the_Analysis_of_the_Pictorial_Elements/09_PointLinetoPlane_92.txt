Some of the possible variations of the curved line must still be mentioned.
II 2. A complex curved wave-like line can consist of:
or
Wave-like
Line
1. geometric parts of circle,
a or
2. free parts,
or
3. various
combinations of these.
These three types cover all the forms of the curve. Some examples will
confirm this rule.
Curve geometric wave-like:
—
Equal radius—uniform alternation of positive and negative pressure. Hori-
zontal course with alternating tensions and release (Fig.
41).
