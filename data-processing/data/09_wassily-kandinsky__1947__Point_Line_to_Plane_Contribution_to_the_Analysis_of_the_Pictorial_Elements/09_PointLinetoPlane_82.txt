are correct, the following conclusions be
If the parallels just made may
from comparison of the two: the sounds characteristics
drawn a and of
produce, in certain cases, a sum of characteristics which
the components
covered in the first group. Similar facts are not unknown to other
are not
sciences, e.g., chemistry: the sum divided into its components in many

cases fails to be restored in the combination of the components. Perhaps,
in such cases, one is confronted with an unknown law, whose vague appear-
ance seems deceptive.

In chemistry, the equality sign ?=*, which
is not used in such cases, but rather, a
points to relationships. My task is out relationships between the
to point "organic"
elements of painting. Even in cases where impossible identities, that is,
it is to establish
to prove them conclusively, I will indicate
their inner relationship by the use of two
arrows 3=^. Furthermore, one must
not in such cases be deterred by possible mistakes:
the truth infrequently
is not reached by way of error.

The origin
of the circle will be described in the analysis of curved lines—attack and
yielding resistance.
The circle is, at all events,
a special case among the three primary forms—straight lines
are unable to create it.
