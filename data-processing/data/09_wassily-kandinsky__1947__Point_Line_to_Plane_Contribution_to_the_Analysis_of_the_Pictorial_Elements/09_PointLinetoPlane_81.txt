The next jump of is the transition from angular lines to straight lines:
ABC .... black. Horizontal.
Since, however, the typical angles in their continued development can
form planes, the further relationships between line-plane-colour arise auto-
matically. We may therefore make the following diagrammatic indica-
tion of the line-plane-colour relationships:
