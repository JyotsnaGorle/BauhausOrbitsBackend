I B I . The simplest forms of angular lines consist of two parts, and are Angles
the result of two forces which have discontinued their action after a single
thrust. This simple process leads, moreover, to an important difference
between straight and angular lines: the angular line is in much closer touch
with the plane, and it already carries something plane-like within it. The
plane is in the process of creation, and the angular line becomes a bridge.
The differences between the countless angular lines depend entirely upon
the sires of the angles, in accordance with which they can be divided into
three typical groups:
with acute — 45°
a) angles
b) with right — 90°
angles
— 135°
c) with obtuse angles
The remainder are atypical acute or obtuse angles, and deviate from
the typical in the number of their degrees. Thus, with the first three
angular lines, a fourth—an atypical angular line—can be included.
d) with a free angle,
because of which this angular line must be designated as a free angular
line. 69
