A form in a manner from the circle is the spiral (Fig. 37); the
force acting from within exceeds the outer in a uniform measure. The spiral is, therefore,
a circle going off its track in a uniform manner. Besides this difference, another
can be observed which, for painting, is much more significant: the spiral is a line,
while the circle is a plane. Geometry does not make this distinction which is exceed-
ingly important for painting; aside from the circle, it designates the ellipse, the figure
eight and similar piano forms as lines (curves). The term used here, the "curved line,"
is not the equivalent of the more exact geometric terminology (parabola, hyperbola,
etc.) for geometry, from its standpoint on the basis of formulae, must inevitably make
classifications which in this connection are out of the question for painting. 81
