The point is created in such a way that the instrument does not touch it
the point is encircled—like a fortress—with a ditch, and great care is taken
not to injure it. In order that the point may enter the world, it is necessary
to do violence to its entire surroundings; to tear them out and destroy
them.
The colour is rolled onto the surface in such a way that it covers the point
already
and leaves the surrounding area free. The future print can be
clearly seen upon the block.

Lithography:
The plate: stone, clay of an indefinable yellow—warm.
The tools: pen, crayon, brush,
any more or less pointed object with surfaces
of contact of the most varied
sizes. Lastly, a fine atomizer (spray tech-
nique). Great diversity, great
flexibility.
The colour rests lightly
and insecurely. Its union with the block is very loose
and it can easily
be removed by grinding—the stone returns immediately
to its original
chaste condition.
