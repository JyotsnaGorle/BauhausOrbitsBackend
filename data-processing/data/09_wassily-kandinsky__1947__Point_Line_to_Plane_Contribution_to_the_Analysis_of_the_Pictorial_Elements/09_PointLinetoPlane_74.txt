This means that it is not easy to fix a limit for the complex and to use
the elementary exclusively. Nevertheless, these experiments and observa-
tions offer the only means of getting to the bottom of pictorial things
which serve the ends of composition. This method is employed by science
itself, and has thereby attained—despite excessive one-sidedness—a pri-
marily external order and continues today with the aid of keen analysis
to forge its way through to primary elements. In this manner it has, after
all, placed before philosophy a rich and well-ordered body of material
which—sooner or later—will lead to synthetic results. The science of art
must travel the same road, in the course of which, however, it should from
the very outset unite the external with the inner.
During the gradual transition from horizontal to free acentric lines,
The Lyric

the cold lyric character is transformed into an ever warmer one until it
Dramatic
finally acquires a certain dramatic flavor. The lyric quality, nevertheless,
remains dominant. The entire field of straight lines is lyric, a fact which
can be explained by the effect of a single force from the outside. The
dramatic (and in the cases mentioned, the acentric) carries within it
aside from the sound caused by relocation—the sound collision
of as well,
for which at least two forces are necessary.
The action of two forces in the realm of the line can take in
place two
ways:
1. the two forces alternate with each other alternate action,
2. the two forces act together
simultaneous action.
It is evident that the
second process is more temperamental and, thereby,
"hotter," especially since this process can
be looked upon as the result of
the action of many alternating forces.
Correspondingly,
the dramatic effect mounts, until at last purely dra-
matic lines come into existence.
