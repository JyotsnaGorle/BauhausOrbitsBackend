different ways: an
The concept, element, can be understood in two as 'Element"
and
external, and, as an inner concept.
Element
Inward-
Externally, each individual graphic or pictorial form is an element.
within
ly, it is not this form itself but, rather, the tension it, which consti-
tutes the element.
In fact, no materializing of external forms expresses the content of a work

of painting but, rather, the forces=tensions which are alive within it.
tensions disappear
If by some magic command these were to or to expire,
the work, which is alive at that very instant, would die. On the other hand,
every accidental grouping of several forms could be called a work of art.
The content of a work of art finds its expression in the composition: that
is, in the sum of the tensions inwardly organized for the work.
This seemingly simple statement has a highly important, fundamental
significance: it divides into these two opposing groups not only the present
day artists, but the present day men altogether, depending on their
acceptance or rejection of it:
1. those persons who recognize not only material things but also the
existence of the immaterial or spiritual, and
2. those who choose to accept nothing beyond material evidence.
For the second category, art cannot exist and, consequently, these people
today repudiate the very word "art" while seeking a substitute for it.
To my way of thinking, one might distinguish element from
"element":
that is, the term "element" would signify the form separated from
the
inner tension, and by element, the tension alive within this form.
The
elements are, therefore, in reality abstract, while the form in
is itself
"abstract." If it were actually possible to work with
abstract elements,
external contemporary painting would become radically
