in this magical nimbus.) The human figure, the actor, naked or in white 
tights, stands in space. Before him, the receptive spectator, awaiting every 
motion, every action. Behind him, the security of a wall; at each side, the 
wings for his entrance and exit. This is the situation which any person 
creates who instinctively steps back from a group of two or more curious 
spectators in order to "act out" something for them. It is the basic situation 
which produced the peep show. It might even be called the origin of all 
theatrics. 
From this point on, two fundamentally different creative paths are pos- 
sible. Either that of psychic expression, heightened emotion, and panto- 
mime (illustration 3); or that of mathematics in motion, the mechanics of 
joints and swivels, and the exactitudes of rhythmics and gymnastics (illus- 
trations 5 ff.). Each of these paths, if pursued to its end, can lead to a 
work of art. Similarly, the fusion of the two paths can result in a unified art 
form. The actor is now so susceptible to being altered, transformed, or 
"entranced" by the addition of some applied object - mask, costume, prop 
- that his habitual behavior and his physical and psychic structure are 
either upset or else put into a new and altogether different balance. (The 
nature of the actor, and of the potential actor, is best revealed in the depth 
of the transformation of his behavior as effected by these inanimate at- 
tributes, a cigarette, hat, cane, suit, or whatever it might be.)
