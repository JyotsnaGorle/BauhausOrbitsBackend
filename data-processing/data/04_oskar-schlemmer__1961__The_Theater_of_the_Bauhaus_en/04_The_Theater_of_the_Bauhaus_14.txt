formance from one stage position to another and by using a system of spot- 
lights and film projectors, transforming walls and ceiling into moving picture 
scenes, the whole house would be animated by three-dimensional means 
instead of by the 'flat' picture effect of the customary stage. This would also 
greatly reduce the cumbersome paraphernalia of properties and painted 
backdrops. 
"Thus the playhouse itself, made to dissolve into the shifting, illusionary 
space of the imagination, would become the scene of action itself. Such a 
theater would stimulate the conception and fantasy of playwright and stage 
director alike; for if it is true that the mind can transform the body, it is 
equally true that structure can transform themind."
