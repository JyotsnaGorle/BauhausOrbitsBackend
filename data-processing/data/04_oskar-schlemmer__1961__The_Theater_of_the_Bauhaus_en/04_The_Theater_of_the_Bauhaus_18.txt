The theater, which should be the image of our time and perhaps the one 
art form most peculiarly conditioned by it, must not ignore these signs. 
Stage (Buhne), taken in its general sense, is what we may call the entire 
realm lying between religious cult and nafve popular entertainment. Neither 
of these things, however, is really the same thing as stage. Stage is representa- 
tion abstracted from the natural and directing its effect at the human being. 
This confrontation of passive spectator and animate actor preconditions 
also the form of the stage, at its most monumental as the antique arena and 
at its most primitive as the scaffold in the market place. The need for con- 
centration resulted in the peep show or "picture frame," today the "universal" 
form of the stage. The term theater designates the most basic nature of the 
stage: make-believe, mummery, metamorphosis. Between cult and theater 
lies "the stage seen as a moral institution"; between theater and popular 
entertainment lie variety (vaudeville) and circus: the stage as an institution 
for the artiste. (See accompanying diagram.) 
The question as to the origin of life and the cosmos, that is, whether in the 
beginning there was Word, Deed, or Form - Spirit, Act, or Shape - Mind, 
Happening, or Manifestation - pertains also to the world of the stage, and 
leads us to a differentiation of: 
the oral or sound stage (Sprech-oder Tonbuhne) of a literary or musical 
event; 
the play stage ( Spielbiihne ) of a physical-mimetic event; 
the visual stage ( Schaubuhne ) of an optical event.
