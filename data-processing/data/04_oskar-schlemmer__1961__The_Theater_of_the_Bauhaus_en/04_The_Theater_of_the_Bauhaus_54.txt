Stage Construction for the "Mechanical Ballet" 
KURT SCHMIDT 
permits him at best only a certain range of action, dependent entirely on his 
natural body mechanism. 
The effect of this body mechanism (Korpermechanik) (in circus per-

spectator's astonishment or shock at the potentialities of his own organism 
as demonstrated to him by others. This is a subjective effect. Here the human 
body is the sole medium of configuration (Gestaltung). For the purposes of 
an objective Gestaltung of movement this medium is limited, the more so 
since it has constant reference to sensible and perceptive (i.e., again literary) 
elements. The inadequacy of "human" Exzentrik led to the demand for a pre-
