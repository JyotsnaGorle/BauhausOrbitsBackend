This latter form (Fig. 65) can be expanded through increased motion
at the fixed guidance point of the pendulum. The observable signifi
cance of such a form contiunity, originating at the guidance point, is
transposed into larger mobile forms. The purest mobile form, the cos

This moment (Fig. 66) is imagined
as occurring while the pendulum
is in full swing. It will circum

of mobile forms.

Changing length of the radius, combined with peripheral motion, trans
forms the circle into the spiral. Lengthening of the radius creates a
vibrant spiral. Shortening of the radius narrows the curve more and
more, till the lovely spectacle dies suddenly in the static center. Motion
here is no longer finite; and the
question of direction regains new
importance. This direction deter
mines either a gradual liberation
from the center through freer and
freer motions, or an increasing
dependence on an eventually de
structive center.
This is the question of life and
