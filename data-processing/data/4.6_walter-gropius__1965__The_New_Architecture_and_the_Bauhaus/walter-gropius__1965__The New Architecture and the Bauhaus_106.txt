ies over the adoption of sky craper construc­
tion in European cities the peculiarity of Ameri­
can conditions has become a sort of red herring 
for both side . That the skyscraper districts of 
T e"v York and Chicago are a planless chaos is 
no argument per se against the expediency of 
multi-storied office-buildings. The problem is 
one that can only be solved by control of building 
den ity in relation to transport facilities, and by 
curbing the crying evil of speculation in land 
values: elementaryprecautions"\vhich have been 
ignally neglected in the United States. We 
have the inestimable advantage of initiating our 
o'vn era of building upwards with a much truer 
understanding of the issues involved. That this 
form of construction has become inevitable in 
Europe is all the more reason for being thor­
oughly prepared for it. New York offers per­
fect cautionary examples of lack of foresight 
and what not to allow: dependence on artificial 
light throughout the day bet,veen the ground 
and fifteenth floors, and hundreds of millions 
of dollars sunk in tube railways that can never 
pay because they were built too late to serve
