struggle for existence. Thus such skill as it ac足
quired was of that amateurish studio-bred order 
which is innocent of realities like technical pro足
gress and commercial demand. The besetting 
vice of the academy schools was that they were 
obsessed by that rare 'biological' sport, the com足
manding genius; and forgot that their business 
was to teach drawing and painting to hundreds 
and hundreds of minor talents, barely one in a 
thousand of whom could be expected to have 
the makings of a real architect or painter. In the 
vast majority of cases this hopelessly one-sided 
instruction condemned its pupils to the lifelong 
practice of a purely sterile art. Had these hapless 
drones been given a proper practical training they 
could have become useful members of society. 
The rise of the academies spelt the gradual 
decay of the spontaneous traditional art that 
had permeated the life of the whole people. All 
that remained was a 'Salon Art', entirely re足
mote from everyday life, which by the middle 
of the XIXth Century had petered out into 
mere exercises in individual virtuosity. It was
