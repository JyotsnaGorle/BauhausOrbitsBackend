THE NEW ARCHITECTURE 
AND THE BAUHAUS 
Walter Gropius 
A reissue o f one o f the most important boo ks on the modern 
mo vement in architecture. THE NEW ARCHITECTURE AND THE BAUHAUS, 
comments The Times Literary Supplement, " has all the permanence 
of a classic." 
Translated fro m the G erman by P. Morton Shand, with a Preface 
by Frank Pick, Professor Gropius' book poses some of the funda­
mental problems presented by the relations of art and industry and 
considers their possible, practical solution . In tracing the rise of the 
New Architecture and the work of the now famous Bauhaus, Profes­
sor Gropius, with splendid clarity, calls fo r a new artist and architect 
educated to new materials and techniques and directly confronting 
the requirements of his own age. 
THE NEW ARCHITECTURE AND THE BAUHAUS will be welcomed by 
the general reader as well as the student of architecture.
