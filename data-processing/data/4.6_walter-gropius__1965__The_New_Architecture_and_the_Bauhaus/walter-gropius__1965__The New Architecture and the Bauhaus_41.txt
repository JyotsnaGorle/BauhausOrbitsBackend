joints, warping and staining, unforeseen piece­
work, andseriouslossoftime andmoneythrough 
delays in drying. By eliminating this factor, and 
so assuring the perfect interlocking of all com­
ponent parts, the pre-fabricated house makes it 
possible to guarantee a fixed price and a definite 
period of construction. Moreover the use of 
reliable modern materials enables the stabilitv 
·' 
and insulation of a building to be increased and 
its weight and bulk decreased. A pre-fabricated 
house can be loaded on to a couple of lorries at 
the factory walls, floors, roof, fittings and all 
-conveyed to the site, and put together in next 
to no time regardless of the season of the year. 
The outstanding concomitant advantages of 
rationalized construction are superior econonty 
and an enhanced standard of living. Many of the 
things that are regarded as luxuries today will 
be standard fitments in the homes of tomorrow. 
So much for technique! But what about 
beauty?
