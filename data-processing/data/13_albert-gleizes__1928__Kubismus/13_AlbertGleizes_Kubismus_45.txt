Obituary note by Walter Gropius
With Moholy-Nagy’s untimely death a life of tremendous vitality, will
power
and love
has been zenith. When beloved friend irrevocably
cut short at its a disappears
into
silence, the in
sudden loss enlightens our consciousness a flash so that we
recognize
the truth more
clearly than before.
Moholy-Nagy
has bequeathed to us a wealth of art works and writings,
which
embrace the
whole range of the visual arts. We might call the scope of his
contribution
“Leonardion,”
so versatile and colorful has it been. He was successful at
once as a
thinker
and as an inventor, as a writer and as a teacher. This would seem to
be almost
too vast a field for one versatility was uniquely
man to till, but abundant his. With
his
power of imagination
he kept this tremendous variety of interests in balance. His
vision
took brilliant
shortcuts, synchronizing his observations into a consistent whole, for
he felt
today’s danger of over-specialization which leads to fallacies.
Constantly developing new ideas, he himself in
managed to keep a state of unbiased
curiosity, from which a fresh point of view could originate. With a shrewd
sense of
observation he investigated everything that his way, taking nothing for
came granted,
but using his acute sense for the
organic.
I remember his peculiar
freshness when he was facing a new problem in his art.
With the attitude
of an unprejudiced, happy child at play, he surprised one by
the
directness
of his intuitive approach. Here was the source of his priceless quality
as an
educator: his never-ceasing power to stimulate to carry away
and the other person
with his own enthusiasm. Can true
education achieve more than setting the student’s
mind in motion by that
contagious magic?
This book, which has proved to be “the standard grammar of modern design,*' gives
broadest evidence of the decisive part which Moholy-Nagy has
played in the history of
the visual arts, for it has revealed a new mental attitude in
contemplating, observing
and forming this, our physical world. It will
gain in time when weaker eyes have learned
to see through
his.
