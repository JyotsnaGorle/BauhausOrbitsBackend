IV. Space (architecture) Space is
a reality. Despite this
bewildering array,
we know that space
is a reality
of sensory
experience. It is
a human experience
like others; it is a means
of expression
like
others. Other realities,
other materials.
Space is a reality,
and once it has
been comprehended in
its essence, it can
be
grasped according to
its own laws,
and arranged according
to them. As a matter
of
fact, man has
constantly tried to
use this reality this
f/.e., material) in the service
of his
urge for
expression, no less than
the other realities
which he has encountered.
Space experience is
not a privilege of gifted
architects but is a biological
function
,
of everyone.
The biological base of
space experience is
everyone’s endowment,
just as is the
experience of color or
of tone. By practice
and suitable exercises
this
capacity
can be developed. To
be sure, there will be many
degrees of difference,
from
minimum to maximum
capacity, but basically space
experience is accessible
to every-
one, even in its rich,
complicated forms.
Its grasp is of
the greatest help in
conceiving any design.
