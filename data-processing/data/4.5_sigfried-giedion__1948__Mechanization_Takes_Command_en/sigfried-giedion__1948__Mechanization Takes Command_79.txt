between the tumblers into the same line.' Thus the key acts only to adjust 
the pin tmnblers. The key's small inclined planes serving this purpose made it, 
in the words of a contemporary, 'resemble a worn-out saw.' 
At the same time the square tang of the key, with its bits, or dentation, has 
disappeared. The key has become small and thin, and can he punched or stamped 
in a moment. Above all, its function has changed. It does not act directly on 
the bolt, as it had done ever since man invented the closing mechanism: it 
merely turns the revolving cylinder. The key is now a mere handle for that 
purpose. 
'Prior to Yale's invention the size of the key was proportioned to the size of 
the lock and its length was necessarily such as to enable it to reach through the 
21 
door.' As Yale conceived it, however, the plug wonld revolve when acted 
upon by the key, while the bolt conld be placed independently of it. Thus the 
door could be of any thickness, the lock and key remaining unchanged in size 
and uniform with all other locks and keys of the same type. This led to the uni­
versal adoption of standard locks and of standard-sized keys for doors of the 
most diverse kinds. The painstaking illustration in the Yale and Towne cat­
alogue of 1889 (fig. 37) gives a glimpse into the mechanism hy tearing away
