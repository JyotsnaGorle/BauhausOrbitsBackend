and repairing roads and ways,' the second: 2 Aug. 1812, British Patent 9-t3J. 'Apparatus for cleaning 
roads.' This is also the first American patent for street~cleaning machinery: U.S. Patent 312-i, 1 June 
1843. The Patent of 1840 includes, among other features, an early (perhaps the first.) use of the large 
rotary brush, which Whitworth calls a 'circular broom.' It was driven by a crossed sprocket chain.
