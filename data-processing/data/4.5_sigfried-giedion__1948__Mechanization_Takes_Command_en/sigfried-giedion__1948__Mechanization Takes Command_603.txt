The standard types were cTeated within a few years after this lapse of several 
decades. The years 1901 and 1902 brought the first satisfactory fixed vacuums 
in America and in England. The first portable vacuum cleaner is said to have 
143 
materialized in 1905. But this American machine with large turbine fan and 
motor mounted on a chassis was still rather voluminous and closer to the French 
machines on wheels than to the later and lighter instruments. Two years later, 
1907, the patent was submitted for a more portable machine tending towMd the 
144 
now standard form. (fig. 372). Now the fan revolves around a vertical spindle 
directly coupled to the motor, just as in Tesla's electric fan of 1889. The care­
fully shaped motor-casing is made to carry a swivel handle. In brief, the carpet 
sweeper has been mechanized. The main trend is now toward simplifying and 
reducing the number of parts. The inventor formulates this in his next patent 
(1915) (fig. 421): 'The object of this invention is to provide a construction wlricb 
will be eornposed of few simple parts, put together in a practical mechanical 
145 
marmer.' 
In short, hardly more than five years elapsed from the advent of the cmnber­
sorne fixed vacuum to the creation of the portable standard form in. which the 
vacuum became an everyday household tool. 
416. The Basic American VacuumM 
Cleaner Pat.ent; 1903. From 1902 on, 
stationary plants, whose pipes ran through 
the slrnclure like central heating, were in­
in the larger American buildings­
stalled 
Astor Hotel, Frick Building (1902). Right: 
1'he first and basic patent for both fixed and 
portable vacuum cleaners was that of D. T. 
Kenney: 'Separdor for appara!us for re~ 
moving du.sl,' 1903. llere l!te hand,'e and ihe 
hose are still d:'slmcl. Left: The vacuum

:rears after his first palcni Kenney ran the _, 
suction through a tubular handle u·ith a dust 
inlet slot at its end, mounting the whale 
flexibly on wheel$. From this the bag fype 
of today wa"~ apparenlly derired. (U.S.

type was developed.
