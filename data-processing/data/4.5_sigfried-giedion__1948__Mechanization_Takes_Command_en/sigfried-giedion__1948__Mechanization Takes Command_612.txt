MECHANICAL REFRIGERATION AFTER 1800 
The universally minded eighteenth century was interested in the overall view, 
in cyclic processes, Giambattista Vico, in his Scienza Nuo"a (1730) looks for 
cyclical processes in history: who knows the history of one people knows the 
history of all peoples, Parallel with this, there is a turning of awareness to 
cyclic processes in physics and to their utilization in practical life. Contempo足
raries found a most strong stimulus to their inventive fantasy in the gas-to足
liquid, liquid-to-solid cycle and its reverse, 
The cyclic passage from water to steam and from steam back to water led 
the practical mind of James Watt, with a minimum of techoical knowledge, to 
the invention of the condenser (1769), the function of which is to recondense 
water vapor after expansion to suh-atmospheric pressure, This supplied the 
missing link in the cycle, and the modern steam engine was made possihle, 
Mechanical refrigeration relies upon a similar method, A liquid of low 
boiling point is in turn evaporated and reliqueJied, Through evaporation it 
absorbs heat from its enviroument, in other words produces cold, Michael 
Faraday is known as the first successful experimenter in mechanical refrigera足
tion, He observed in 1823, during his study of gases, that ammonia heated in 
a U-tuhe would recondense in the other limh, Left to itself the ammonia would 
evaporate anew, producing intense cold, No more than he thought of utilizing 
for practical purposes the electric motor, whose principle he was to discover 
nine years later, did Faraday think of a utilitarian exploitation of the discovery 
157 
upon which mechauical refrigeration is hased, 
The first precise scientific vision of how cold might be mechanically produced 
and utilized is found in an apparently overlooked passage of Oliver Evans's 
Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide, Philadelphia, 1805, Oliver Evans, 
who introduced the earliest production line in the milling process, is, in concep足
tion at least, the father of modern cold-making, He starts from the observation: 
'If an open glass be filled with ether and set in water under vacuo, the ether will 
1
boil rapidly and rob the water of its latent heat till it freezes, , , , ' " Evans 
now sets himself a problem similar to the earlier one in which he transformed 
the endless belt and the Archimedean screw into the assembly line: how and 
for what purposes can physical laws be utilized? Evans imagines refrigeration 
of the drinking water reservoirs of American cities, and proposes a powerful 
vacuum pump driven by a steam engine to volatilize ether, thus taking heat 
m Jat,-ob Perkins, an American living in England, used ether in the first compression machines in 1834. 
Ferdinand Carre, who in 1857 patented the first commercially exploitable ice-making machine, later 
(1859) used like Faraday a solution of ammonia and water.
