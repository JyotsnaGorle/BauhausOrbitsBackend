354. RUMFORD: Portable Sheet-Iron Stove with Tapering Firebox, c,l800, Rumford, wlw introduced 
soup kilehens for the poor, later proposed this cooking range to conserve fuel for the working classes, Note 
the sunken ,'faucepan with cleverly designed handle, The heat source is eoncentraied in a perforated conical 
[Lre chamber, 
like a bird's nest, as in Rumford's range; the surrounding of this chamber by 
air; perforation of the chamber walls, which as in Rumford's model taper toward 
43 
the bottom, We may take it that a man of Stewart's type must have been 
acquainted with Rumford's writings, which enjoyed an extraordinary wide 
public, He nevertheless went his own way, for he had to join his theoretical 
knowledge of heat with the stove as developed in America from 1800 on. 
When he patented his first stove in 1834, Stewart, thinking that the royalties 
might yield some income, made over the patent rights to his college. These are 
356. Range wlth Rotary Plate, 1845, Hundreds of mid-century 
patents express lhe interest in cast~iron stoves and ranges, Unconven~ 
iion.al ideas occur, such w this labor~saving det•ice of a rotar-y plale f.o 
move the pans, 'The heal can be made to act either upon the rotary plate 
or the $ta.tionary boiler or both at pl.ea.mre, f1y merely changing the 
dampers! (US Palent42-i8, 1 Not•ember ]8,1$)
