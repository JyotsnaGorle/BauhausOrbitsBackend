in special channels and reservoirs, did not come into contact with the fire gases. 
Not only was the method more effieient, but the air in the baking chamber 
remained entirely pure. This oven was used with success in French hospitals in

The aerothcrrne oven (1832) of the Frenchman Arihert retains some char­
acteristics of the old baking oven. The bread trays were slowly carried on rails 
through the straight or circular hot-air tunnels from a hotter to a cooler zone. 
92. Mechanized Bakery, Mouchot Bros., 1847. The fll'sl bakery successfully rnechanized in France. The 
partial mechanization found here is characteristic-of E'uropean bakeries to the preNenl day. Their smal!-.~cale 
equipment permits only the mosl strenuous tasks lobe performed mechanically. (C. H. Schmidt, Das deutsche 
Bi:i.ckerhandwerk) 
This aerothermc oven, which shows beginnings of distinctly meehanical opera­
tion, was to be found in several French ci-ties around 184,0.17 
Finally, toward mid-century, steam heat was employed." The earliest to do 
this was Angier March Perkins (1799-1881), foremost exponent of hot-water 
heating for dwellings. An American living in England, he first worked with hot­

air heating, but soon shifted to hot-water coils. He even hoped to use steam in

offered a prize for a 'four aerotherme,' with a specially efficient system of heat drculation. Cf. Benoit, 
op.cit. vol. 1, pp.231ff. 
n Rollet, op,cit. p.HO, states that in Gap, Grenoble, Avignon,and other cities,' it is heated with anthra· 
cite or soft coal.' Cf. plates l\1 and N, and Atlas val., pl.45.

early eighteenth century (British Patent 430, 25 June 1720).
