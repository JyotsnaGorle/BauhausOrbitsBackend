(Andrew Shirley, Bonington, 
London, 1941) 
Bonington shows the woman fully clothed and relaxing, her head framed in 
a shawl. Unconstrained posture seems to have developed in an Empire society 
that felt drawn to Court without having been born into it. The furniture it 
created was stiff outwardly, but seems to have heen used in quite a different 
manner. Among Bonington's earlier works is a copy after the court-painter 
Gerard, showing a lady, said to be Josephine, seated on an Empire sofa, sharply 
rectangular in outline (fig. 242). She uses it diagonally, her feet on the floor, 
legs aslant to the seat, trunk resting backwards in the angle. It is significant that 
Bonington copied this picture of the otherwise tediously conventional Gerard. 
Richard Bonington died of consumption in 1326 at the age of twenty-five. 
He knew what sitting and lying meant. In a letter to a French friend he tells 
of the reclining chair existing only in his invalid's dream. 
Bonington's study of the 'Reclining Woman' with its easy, flowing treatment 
is a portrait of nineteenth-century posture. The line of chairs adjustable to 
the body stretches muntlessly from the 1B30's down to LeCorbusier.
