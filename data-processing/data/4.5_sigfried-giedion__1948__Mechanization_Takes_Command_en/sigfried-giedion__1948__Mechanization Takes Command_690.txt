466. Garments for the Atmospheric 
Cure. Dr. Rikli, c.l870. In the 'sixties, 
the Swiss Arnold Rikli (1823--1906) 
attempted to expWit systematically the 
benefiCial effects of radiation. Sun 
baihing and open-ai.r exercise were the 
ba.~1:C elemenU; of his cure. Rikli made 
his patients wear shorts, sandals, and 
open-necked and slwrt-sleeved shirts. 
In the lime of paNU>ols these garments 
were worn by a few eccentrics walking 
behind the high fences that surrvrmded his 
sanatorium. (Dr. Arnold Rikli, I.et

mon with Rikli's prndent dosage of the rays. Altogether nnskilled in its nse, 
the people dazedly leave theiT bodies to roast in the sun. Civic authorities 
pride themselves when, after mauy struggles, they have succeeded in wresting 
a stretch of beach for the recreation of the masses. Establishments of this sort 
record all the ineptitude and helplessness of our period when faced with the 
problem of regeneration. The people are ignorant about what is permissible in 
dealing with the body and what is not. Everything is left to the dilettante 
fancy of the individnal. There are books and rnles, with do's and don't's, hnt 
the complete lack of a tradition in which, from childhood np, barmonions treatÂ­
ment of one's body might he so learned as to become second natnre. The rnles 
of snn bathing are often given as beanty hints in women's magazines."

architect Philip Webb to design some drinking glasses for his personal use.
