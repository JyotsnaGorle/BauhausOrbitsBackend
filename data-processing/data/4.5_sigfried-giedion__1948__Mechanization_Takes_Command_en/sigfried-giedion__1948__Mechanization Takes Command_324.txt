172. Candlestick, Juste-AurCle Meissonier, 1728. Meissonier transforms church far;ades (St Sufpice, 
Paris) and interiors, tureenR and candlesticks into a 1Dhir/wind of motion. To do this tcilhoul loss of 
dignify demands, in art, an equipoi~~e comparable lo that of the tightrope walker. 
The cavalier of l,ouis XV's daJ~ sits smnewbaL informally. Here again chair 
and posture are one, the outcome of a long tradition. Here again the posture 
is relaxed- a prerequisite of all repose- but it is constantly modified by slight 
changes. It is not static repose. The cavalier turns toward this side or that. 
One leg is slantingly crossed over the other, the recurrent altitude in late eight­
12 
eenth-century engravings (fig. 168). We do not imply that the Rococo in­
vented this informal posture. But it was then that such deportment became 
typical. Portraits around 1700 show one leg extended forward, the other drawn 
back: a transitional posture amid a transitional style. Hococo fautenil.<, with 
their short armrests curving outwards in deference to ladies' fa8hion, \Yerc no 
Jess favorable to the sa.ns-gene posture of the masculine visitors. 
tz Representations of this sort only become preYalent in the later, p:enre-oricnted 
decades. At the beginning of Louis XVTs period: the cavalier at his toilet, 'La 
petite toilette,' engraving after 1\1oreau le jeune (17-11-1814), by P. S. :'Vlartini; cr 
'Le petit jour,' after Freudenberger (171·5-1801), engraving after Nicolas de Launay 
(1739-92).
