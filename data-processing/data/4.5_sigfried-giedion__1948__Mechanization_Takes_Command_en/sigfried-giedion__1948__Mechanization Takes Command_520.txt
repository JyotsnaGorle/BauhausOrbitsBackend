of 187 4 were non-resilient. Resilient seating - as we noted in the American 
patent movement -means relaxation through slight variations of posture. 
The attempt was made in the Bauhaus at Dessau to bend plywood for seats 
and back rests, to utilize its resilient qualities when mounted on regular four­
22 
legged chair frames (1928).
Meanwhile, the aviation industry found new methods of bonding the ply­
wood lamina, as by resin glue. Aalto still had to steam-curve his plywood. 
Resin glue permits dry bonding, by electrical means with hydraulic pressure. 
This opens fresh possibilities to the c,onstructor. From 1939 on, the Institute 
of Design in Chicago, under the leadership of L. Moholy-Nagy, made extensive 
trials, seeking to raise the elasticity and resilience of plywood, and at the same 
time to inject a degree of mobility into the system as a whole. Experiments
