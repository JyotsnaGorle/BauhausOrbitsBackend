298. The First Pullman Drawing 
(Parlor) Car, 1875. The revolving 
and adjustable armchairs with their 
simple oullines are as far from the 
exuberant forms of the 'nineties as 
from the overstuffed streamliners of 
lhe 1930's, (Courtesy of the Pullman 
Company) 
299. Adjustable Folding Chair 
Used in Airplanes, 1936. Allhough 
well-designed from the point of view 
of light materials and in the best tradiÂ­
tion of patent furniture, it Sllf}geRls a 
trend to artificially heavy appearance 
- the oulcome, it would seem, of 
'streamlining,' which perpetuates the 
.~howiness of nineteenlh-cenlury ruling 
taste in so many areas. (Courtesy
