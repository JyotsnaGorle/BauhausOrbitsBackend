These 300 pages 'On the Construction of Kitchen Fireplaces and Kitchen 
Utensils, Together with Remarks and Observations Relating to the Various 
36 
Processes of Cooking and Proposals for Improving that most Useful Art' 
are a store of experience and suggestions based on exhaustive theory and a gift 
for technical solutions. It is almost the outline of what was to follow. 
How was the kitchen equipped in Rmnford's time? There were then no kitchen 
appliances in the present-day sense. All were yet to be invented. 'The kitchen 
fireplace of a family in easy circumstances in this country,' be wrote on his return 
to England, 'consists almost uniformly of a long grate for burning coal placed 
31 
in a wide and open chimney.' In its stead he proposed the range he had evolved 
in Munich, but went a step further. The heat soprce, he repeatedly stresses, 
should be contained within the smallest possible cqmpass. He shows the 'use­
38 
fulness of small iron ovens and the best methods of constructing them,' and, 
39 
before 1800, bad designed 'small ovens for poor families.' Most interesting
