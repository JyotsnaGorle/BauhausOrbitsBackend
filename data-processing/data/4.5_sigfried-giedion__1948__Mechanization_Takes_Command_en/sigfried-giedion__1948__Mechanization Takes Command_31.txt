Device for Rocording the Movements 
of a Muscle. Before 1868. Registering 
reactions of a frog's leg to repealed 
electrical stimulation. (Marey, Du 
mouvement dans les fonctions de la

In this period scientists sncb as Wnndt and Helmholtz were eager to devise 
apparatus to gauge motion in muscles and nerves (fig. 2). Marey is one of these 
great savants, key witnesses today for the constituent side of the nineteenth 
century. 
Movement, movement in all its form- in the blood stream, in the stimulated 
mnsele, in the gait of the horse, in aquatic animals and molluscs, in the flights 
of insects and birds -was the ever-returning burden of Marey's research. 
From the start of his career, when be devised the recorder for the human pulse 
beat, down to his last studies in 1900, when be investigated the eddies of moving 
air streams and registered them on the photographic plate; from his first book 
on the circulation of the blood 'based on a graphical study of the blood,' down 
to his last and most popular book, Le Mouvement (1394), translated into English
