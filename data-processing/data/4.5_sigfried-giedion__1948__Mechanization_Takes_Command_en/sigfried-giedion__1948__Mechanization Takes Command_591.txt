406. Basket Strainer, 1942. In the U.S.r1. even the form and effwiency of the sink oulkl are carefully 
studied. Basket strainers in two movable parts are as unusual as the tabletop range in European production 
of the 1910's. (Courtesy the Schaible Co., Cincinnati) 
the blades of the rotor dash the water against the dishes disposed in their racks.

The manner in which the inventor of the dishwashing machine of 1865 
(fig. 375) gives shape to his thought tells us how soon the reasonings and experi­
ments of the great theoreticians and inventors were reflected in household 
appliances. 
A long incubation then began. Not until the New York State Fair of 1910 
114 
did a manufacturer exhibit a mechanical dishwasher. It was still hand­
cranked as in the 'sixties. Certainly this firm persevered with the problem and 
did not slacken until the present-day electric dishwasher had taken shape. In 
1930 the company was purchased hy General Electric, who began to build their 
own machines. The first square-tub and single-knob-control models were then 
brought out (1932), which, combined with the sink, formed a unit ready to 
merge with the mechanized kitchen- a parallel with the table-top range. New 
combinations are still in the making. 
In contrast to the mechanical refrigerator, ~he electrified dishwashing machine, 
which made its appearance in the 1930's, has had' a relatively limited market. 
It now becomes a precision instrument with a variety of automatic devices 
(fig. 374). It had not yet made its way into the catalogues of the large mail­
order houses, which usually show when an invention has reached the larger 
puhlic. In the contest conducted hy McCall's Magazine in 1943-4, of 11,446 
115 
women answering, only 115 possessed an electric dishwasher.
