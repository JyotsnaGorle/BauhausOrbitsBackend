ing at ease between Chicago and Kansas City in 1388. The patents of the 'fifties 
intended the comfort of their seats to be shared by everybody. 
The attempts pile up, too numerous to list. The inventors were determined 
to conquer comfort for travel, to let each passenger be free to shift his position 
at will. Many of these types were found unfit for practical use, yet they were 
alive with an original, savage, mechanical fantasy that disdained the bard and 
fast, the clinched and riveted, that aspired to realize anything, even the impos­
sible. These railroad seats are the Jules Verniads of furniture. As a totality 
they bear within them the seed of a future development. 
The Sleeping Car: Convertible Seat and Folding Bed 
The creation of the sleeping car as we know it today followed soon after con­
struction of the reversible and adjustable railroad seat was attempted. The 
first American patent is usually token to be one issued in 1854. This patent 
did not yet speak, as later ones were to, of a sleeping car. Its aim was to convert 
a seat into a couch; it belonged among the many experiments in the same 
direction.
