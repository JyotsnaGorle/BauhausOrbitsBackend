changing their significance. The patent 
stales: 'The back rest of the. cha.ir is hinged fn 
the seat. To conve.rt the chair inlo a lounge 
one has only lo fold down the bock res!; a 
folding-leg concealed in the backside of f.he.

the tahle are nnBcrewed in the middle and the bedstead rests on the floor. The 
tahle frame has become a bed frame, and the end leaves, folded upright, have 
become the bed ends. The separate stool is quickly converted into a washstand 
with all necessary 'chamber utensils.' 
The following period steadily broadens this tendency to form variable comÂ­
binations by variable arrangements of the planes. A proposal of 1875 offers at 
39 
first glance a SViivel armchair. On closer examination, we notice that 'the 
back rest of the chair is hinged to the seat ... and the armrests are jointed to 
the back.' The back is upholstered on both sides. In reality it consists of two 
frames that are themselves connected by hinges. To convert the chair into a 
couch, one has only to release a catch 'which holds the frame (K) to the back (B), 
so that said frame may be unfolded.' Within the frame is concealed a folding 
leg that carries the horizontal hack rest. The arms disappear into the frame and 
the swivel chair has become a day-bed (fig. 261). 
An armchair of 137 4 '" (fig. 262) shows this same supple imagination always 
ready to change the significance of the planes in unconventional ways. In type, 
this armchair of metal strips belongs to the family of folding chairs as used
