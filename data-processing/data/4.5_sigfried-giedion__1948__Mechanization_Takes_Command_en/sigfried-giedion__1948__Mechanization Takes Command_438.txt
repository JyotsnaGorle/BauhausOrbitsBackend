258. Folding Chair, 1H69. A 8{ight variation on the clas.~ical X-shapedfaldstool gives a reclining cha1r whose 
curves admirably jit the human body. Convertibility lhrough lhe transmutation of plane surfaces is achieved 
here without complex mechanisms. The inventor describes it thus: 'Somewhat similar to the ordinary camp­
stool. The legs BB, extending with a slight forward inclination above the seat, serve to form ihe back of the 
ciUlir. The space between said combined le,q and backpiecr.s is cuRhioned along its entire length. The seat A. 
cushioned on its undersidR. also, is hinged, at il.s front edge, to the upper ends of the le,qs C. The chair may be 
folded into a compaclformfor transportation or storage.' (U.S. Palen192,133, 29 June 1869)
