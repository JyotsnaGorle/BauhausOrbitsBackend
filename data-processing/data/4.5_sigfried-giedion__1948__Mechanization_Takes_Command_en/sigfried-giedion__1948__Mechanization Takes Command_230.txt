109. Cincinnati, Hog~Slaughtering and Packing: Panoramic Painting. 1873. 
Clutching and slaughtering:' The ends of the arms of the tong arejoin.ed to a chain connected with a pnlley 
resting on an aerial iron rail, suspending the b:!Je hog !tead downwards, and the .mspended animals are pu.~h.ed 
forward in the presence of the executioner , â€¢. ' 
Scalding and scraping: These are here still performed by hand. The following phase represents the origin of 
the assembly line: 
Disembowelling: ' The tendons of the hog are slipped (}!Jer the end of the gambrel placed upon a hook attached

Frederick L. Olmsted, designer of Central Park in New York and one of the

we took occasion uot to visit, satisfied at seeinll the river of blood that flowed

from them.' The more vividly does he convey his impression of the divisiou 
of labor, passing over technicalities. rle recognizes that here already, even in 
the absence of cogwheels, meu' s hauds are traiued to fuuction like machines.
