starting point it became in the nineteenth century, nor was it played upon with 
such freedom of fancy, which often incorporated quite complex mechanisms. 
Again, we choose to illustrate the coming about of this law by a few examples 
that might equally well have been constructeA in the medieval period. 
The Shakers, with their highly skilled handicraft, produced various types of 
combination furniture in the first half of the nineteenth century. Toward the 
middle of the period, some examples of patent furniture dearly foreshadow the
