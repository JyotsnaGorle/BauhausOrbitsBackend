Except for the small electric rrwtor that made if pos­

when placed in the rack are made to occupy a position tangential, corresponding

impinging hoth upon their front and rear surfaces and thus washing them 
effectually.' With great thoroughness and forethought other details are pro­
vided, including even the metal ring fixed to the rim of the tuh 'for the purpose 
of preventing the water from dashing against the underside of the cover and 
working out around the edges of the tuh.' This detail, in somewhat refined 
form, is still in use today. The dishwashing machine likewise remained a 'shelved 
invention' until the advent of the electric motor; for hand propulsion was too 
arduous. In comparison with the refrigerator, the dishwashing machine still 
has a quite small number of users. 
The first appearance of the washing machine that was later successfully to 
mechanize the most toilsome of the housewife's tasks is harder to date precisely. 
In few fields -the revolver or the east-iron stove - was American invention 
more prolific than in the mechanization of laundering. By 1873 we count some 
two thousand patents in this category. 
Actually it is a matter of what question we raise. If we ask when the method 
was first invented that forced hot soapy water through the fabrics, instead of 
scrubbing and rubbing in imitation of the washerwoman, we are brought to
