mechanization of man's most ancient calling. It is no accident that even within 
the American c)}ntinent the early-settled Atlantic States remained compara­
tively passive, while the mechanization was carried through on soil that no 
plowshare had hitherto touched: the Middle West. 
The sudden leap from wilderness to au advanced stage of mechanization, 
intermediary phases being passed over, is observable not only in agriculture. 
lt is one of the most curious phenomena of the American development, whose 
repercussions deserve the dose study and teamwork of sociologists, psychologists, 
and historians.

The Middle West and Mechanized Agriculture 
The revolutionizing of agriculture by mechanization is bound up with a specific 
region, a specific era, and a specific layer of society. It is explained by the meeting 
of these three factors. Hence it stands closely linked to the theater in which it 
was carried through: the Middle West. 
Just as the origin of the planned Greek city is bound up with Ionia, the Gothic 
with the Isle de France, and the Renaissance with Florence, so the mechaniza­
tion of agriculture is indivisibly connected with the prairies of the Middle West. 
The Prairie 
The Middle West embraces the broad prairie landscape spreading out like 
a fan from the basin of the Great Lakes, from Lake Michigan, to the Northwest 
and Southwest. The irregular outline of the Prairie crosses several states, losing
