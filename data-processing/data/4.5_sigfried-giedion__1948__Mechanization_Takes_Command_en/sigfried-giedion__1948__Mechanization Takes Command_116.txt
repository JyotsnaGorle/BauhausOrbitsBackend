he used a black background with a net of co-ordinates to ascertain the various 
phases. 
But this was not a satisfactory solution. It did not make the trajectory of 
the movement clearly visible, and portrayed it only in eonjunction with the 
body. To accomplish the separation, Gilbreth constructed a device of appealing 
simplicity. An ordinary camera and a simple electric bulb were all he needed to 
make visible the absolute path of a movement. He fastened a small electric 
light to the limb that performed the work, so that the movement left its track 
on the plate as a luminous white curve. This apparatus he called a 'motion 
recorder'- Cyclograph. The very form of the movement, invisible to the 
naked eye, is now captured. The light patterns reveal all hesitation or hahits 
interfering with the worker's dexterity and automaticity. In a word, they 
embrace the sources of error as well as the perfect performance. 
Later Gilbreth translated the image of the movement into models conÂ­
structed of wire. These wire curves, their windings, their sinuosities, show 
exactly how the action was carried out. They show where the hand faltered 
and where it performed its task without hesitation. Thus the workman can be 
taught which of his gestures are right and which are wrong. For Gilbreth these

Gilbreth calls 'motion minded.' (Courtesy Lillian M. Gilbrefh)
