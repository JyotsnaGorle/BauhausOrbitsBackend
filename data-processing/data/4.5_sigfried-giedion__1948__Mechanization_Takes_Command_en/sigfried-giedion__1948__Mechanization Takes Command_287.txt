147. Romanesque Chest, Valere Castle Church, Switzerland, 12th Century. Chests were the universal 
furniture of the Middle Ages. They stood in every room, sometimes against the wall, sometimes beside the bed 
or al its fool. Five chests, unique in their powerful cast, have been preserved in ihe Romanesqu.e castle-church 
of Val£re. They hm!e high massive uprights, some of them chip--carved in deep arches. (Courtesy &hweiz.

and Flanders, the Great St. Bernard route. These chests, whose powerful cast 
makes them unique in their kind, have high, massive uprights, some of them 
chip-carved in deep arches. And the same arcade motif is countersunk over 
the entire face of the chest. For all the severity of effect, their construction
