In the hands of the physicists, with the revelation of the structure and functions 
of atomic forces, the conception of the essence of matter has changed and has 
lost its transcendental other-worldly nature, The resulting methodological 
change that bas occurred in modern physics has affected many fields of human 
knowledge and has become the starting-point for new, more abstract conceptions, 
The physicists penetrated to the interior of matter, as did the artists, Objects 
became transparent and their essence was revealed by methods other than 
rational perspective, In another place (Space, 1'ime and Architecture, Cambridge, 
1941) we have discussed these problems and the unconscious parallelism of the 
methods used in different spheres, Here we can merely touch on the disap­
pearance of mechanistic conceptions in domains having to do with the human 
orgarusm. 
In psychology the Gestalt theory, dealing with apprehension of the whole, was 
first stressed by the Austrian professor Christian von Ehrenfcls in 1890, Gestalt 
psychology ended the pseudo-mathematical mechanistic laws that nineteenth­
century psychology had established for the human mind, It sees the whole as 
more than the sum of the parts, just as a melody is more than the sum of separate 
tones. 
Similarly, in biolngy the animate being was considered simply as the sum of its 
separate parts, assembled like those of a machine, Organic processes were 
regarded as purely physico-chemical in nature, as if an organism were a kind of 
chemical plant, 
As mechanization moved towards its peak, biologists recognized the deadlock 
into which this mechanical attitude toward research was leading them, Experi­
ment had already proved that an organism was not entirely resolvable into its 
components, that it consisted of more than a simple sum of its parts, In the whole 
hierarchy of biological pattern, from the single cell to the complex human organ­
ism, there exist always centers directing the genesis of the various parts, The 
nature of wholes as a fundamental feature of the world was expounded by J, C, 
Smuts in his IIolism and Evolution, 1926, in which he applied his method on a 
universal scale, 
In physiology the concept of the human organism as a system of organized func­
tions and not a mere assemblage of parts goes back to Claude Bernard, 1813-78,
