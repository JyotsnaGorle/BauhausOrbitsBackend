63. Fully Automatic Assembly Line. Close...up of IHveting Heads. A series of ouiomali:C riveters, with 
enormous jaws like head,~ of mythical birds, press the ri:IJCts at a single bile. This is the final assembly .~lalion, 
following 552 auiomaUc operations. (Courtesy A. 0. Smith OJrp., Milwaukee, Wis.) 
Here scientific management, so far as it is the analysis of human motions, is 
replaced b)' new tDols of production. Five hundred engineers transform a factor)' 
into an automatic unit. producing more quick!)', cheap!)', and profitabl)', and 
freeing man from mechanical movement. 
This automatic assembl)' line hegins with an 'inspection machine,' which 
74 
'straightens and checks every piece of strip steel as received from the mill.' 
The material is worked upon and moves back and forth through the factory 
on the most varied t)'pes of eonve)'or S)'stems in an uninterrupted process. First 
in a sub-assembl)' line, often in parallel operations, the steel bars are cut, 
punched, and formed. A second group of machines assembles the various parts 
until the)' are final!)' clamped together in the general assemhl)' line (fig. 62).
