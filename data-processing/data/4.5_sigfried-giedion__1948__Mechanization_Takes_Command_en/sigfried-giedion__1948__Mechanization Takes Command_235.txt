the meat was stored on ice, it discolored slightly, and therefore met with some 
unpopularity. 
Complete success was achieved by Gustavus Swift when he conquered the 
New York market in 1882. He had made thoroughgoing preparations. The 
refrigerator car he had constructed with the assistance of a Boston engineer 
32 
(1879) stored its ice in the ceiling, so that the mid air sank slowly past the 
hanging meat down to the floor. In similar fashion he equipped the New York 
storehouse: 300 tons of ice were laid in ahove its strongly insulated walls (fig. 110). 
Such was the success of his first shipment that Harper's Weekly printed an 
abundantly illustrated article, 'Cheaper Beef,' in which the reason for its imme­
diate commercial triumph was hrought out: 'The new departure has already 
depressed the market hy three to four Dollars per hundredweight. . . . The 
present agitation of the heef market which must result in a decided and perma­
nent lowering of the beef prices cannot fail to awake the deepest interest ..•

at least this era of cheep heef has hegun for New York.' 
Statistics show how wholesale transportation of chilled meat took effect. 
Within one year, the numher of live cattle shipped from Chicago snddeuly 
decreased hy 170,000." This was in 1884, in a period in which production was 
ahnost hectically rising in every sphere, just hefore the great hoom of 1885, of 
which the first skyscrapers remain the most lasting monument. 
Packers and the Pacldng Industry 
Chicago's development was organic, and ahnost as anonymous at first as that 
of a gold-mining town. World-famous names do not appear in the packing 
industry until the most arduous part of its rise is over. 
The two greatest packers, Gustavus F. Swift and Philip D. Armour, decided 
to settle in Chicago hesitantly and comparatively late. G. F. Swift (1839-1903) 
hegan the butcher's trade in New England, driving his meat cart from house 
to house. Later he hecame a cattle huyer, visiting the main slaughtering centers, 
Albany, Buffalo, and finally Chicago, to which he came at the age of thirty-six 
with a family of five. By that time, from a quarter-century of business, he had 
set aside $30,000, a capital which, as his son relates," 'even in 1875 was not 
enough' to found a modest-sized packing plant. At first, therefore, he continued 
in !tis cattle trade. He was an expert appraiser, who took pride in the sureness
