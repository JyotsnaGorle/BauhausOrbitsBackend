Cows are no longer taken to pens by the earload to be killed with a pointed 
spear. V.'hen they were, the sticker squatted on boards often placed crosswise 
over the pens awaiting the moment when he could best thrust the spear between 
the eyes of his victim. Today a four-pound hammer is used to smash in the 
skulls of the cattle in a narrow knocking pen; once hit, the animals collapse 
like wooden blocks. It is then that the workmen fasten the chain around the 
hind legs and hoist them to the rail, head downward. At the same time, the 
sticker thrusts a knife into the throat of the unconscious animal. The blood is 
usually gathered in special containers.
