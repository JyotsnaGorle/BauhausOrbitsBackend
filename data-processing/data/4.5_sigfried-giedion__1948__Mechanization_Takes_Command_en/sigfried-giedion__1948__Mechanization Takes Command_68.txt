The Early Stage: The Safe and Burglar-Proof Bank Locks 
4 
The history of the pin-tumbler cylinder lock, known as the 'Yale lock,' is 
closely bound np with the creation of safes and safe locks for preserving val足
uables from fire and theft. 
Cast-iron chests for common purposes were made in England about 1780, 
when cast-iron was first being used in columns and even in coffins. Tbe first 
portable fireproof chests were constructed in France around 1820. Their walls 
consisted of two iron plates with a layer of healrrcsistant material between 
5 
them. Before long they were introduced into the United States. 
In the late 'twenties and the early 'thirties, the Americans tried to improve 
the construction of the safe and the insulating material of its walls. 
Its first success was registered in the early 'thirties on the occasion of a big 
fire; tbe public was greatly impressed to see a safe that had survived, with its 
contents unharmed, the gutting of a building. They spontaneously dubbed it 
6 
the 'Salamander,' but its official name was at first 'fireproof' (as in the Phila足
delphia Directory of 1838) and later, in the 'Jifties, 'iron-safe' (figs. 27, 28).

'Pin-tumbler cylinder lock' is the technical name for Linus Yale's lock, but outside of specialists 
nobody calls it thus. 
~Even in the 'thirties this French safe was not very different from the ancient chests closed with a lid.
