applied for until 1826. But several intermediate stages were never put into the 
shape of patent specifications. 
Chippendale is said to have invented gymnastic chairs consisting of spiral 
springs in several layers. Thomas Sheraton gives a thorough description aud 
drawings of a' chau1her horse' (1793) (fig. 224), designed for the gentleman who, 
eager to take riding exercise in all weathers, might do so gymnastically in his 
own room. The inside of this chamber horse consisted of 'five wainscoat inch 
boards clamped at the ends; to which are fixed strong wire twisted around a 
that when the wire is compressed by those who 
block in regular gradation, so

exercise ezch turn of it may clear itself and fall within each other.' 
Thomas Sheraton describes the springs in great detail, as one aunouncing a 
new invention. 
Also vouching for the novelty of the method is the fact that Sheraton was 
able to construct springs of but very limited extension. The only way he could 
prevent his springs from buckling was to use them in distinct layers separated 
by thin boards. At this point further developments enter the picture.
