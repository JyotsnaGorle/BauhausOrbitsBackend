Hobbs's theatrical procedure was at the same time a brilliant advertisement 
for the lock he was exhibiting for Day & Newell, New York (fig. 31), which 
won the Prize Medal at the London Exhibition. This was the 'Parautoptic 
lock,' for which his firm offered a reward of two-hundred guineas to anyone who 
could pick it. But no one succeeded. 
A. G. Hobbs had invented a way of fastening glass doorknobs into their sockets. 
But first and foremost he was the crack salesman of Day & Newell, New York, 
and had become most dexterous in picking rival manufacturers' locks to sell 
those of his own fmn. Day & Newell's 'Parautoptic lock' ('parautoptic' meant 
preventing internal inspection) had come into use in America in the mid-'forties 
10 
and was also known in Europe before the London Exhibition of 1851.

lock was first manufactured in 1336. 
31. American Bank Lock: Day and Newell's 'ParautopticLock,' 1851. lnlrodttced in America in the 1840's, 
it was indeed the champion of the day, 'from which no impression.~ could be taken.' Its salesman, A. C.llobbs, 
became famous b,y picking Bramah's lock during the Creal London Exhibition of 1851. A few years later 
(1856) the Champion Parauloplic was in turn picked by Linus Yale, Jr., who claims to have cal a wooden key 
for it' s0lef:y by in.~peclion through the keyhole.' Note the free yet sensitive typography of this advertisement of
