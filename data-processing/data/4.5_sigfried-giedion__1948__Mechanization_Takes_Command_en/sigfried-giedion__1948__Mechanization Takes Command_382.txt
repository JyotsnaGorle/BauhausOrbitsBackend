vard's own words were 'imitations of sixteenth-century paintings.' This work, 
although privately commissioned, already has that derivative lifeless tone that 
mass production was soon to spread through the whole interior. What we have 
said of the Empire style must also be said here: The signs of ruling taste were 
present before mechanization took effect. 
While England shaped the workshop of mechanized adornment (stamping, 
pressing, substitute materials), France made ready the intellectual molds in 
which the ruling taste was to run. Chenavard, who was most certainly an 
innovator in this sphere, influenced taste through his albums rather than through 
the art objects which he designed for the court of Louis Philippe.
