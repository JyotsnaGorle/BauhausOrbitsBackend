ntetrical proportion. 'One mark,' he points out in 1883, 'provides enough 'Yater 
for 666 showers but only for 33 tub baths. And for the whole of Germany,' he 
argues in his plea for the shower as a People's Bath, 'this means an approximate 
saving of over 66 millions a year ... .' 
Only by economic proof could Dr. Lassar hope to make the shower bath 
attractive to the authorities. Dr. Lassar's efforts were doubtless prompted by 
an ethical purpose, yet the spectacle also has ita pitiful side: a century of mecha­
nization able to offer nothing better than iron huts for the regeneration of the 
masses. No small gap lies between the outlook that produced the thermae of 
Rome and that for which iron huts seemed a solution. And the inspiration for 
these was apparently oweAI to the public urinals that sprang up on the street 
corners of Haussman's Paris as soon as the city obtained a more adequate sewer 
system.

to the public generally are t!wse which do not require a large supp(y , 
of water.' This English opinion of 1850 was that held throughout -: 
the cenlury. Even in the 'e(qhties, showers were contemplated as the'-
only ecorwmically possible form of 'people's bath.' (Lassar,

These corru.galed~iron huts were to be erected on the streets so as to 
encourage passers-by to use them. (Lassar, Ueber Volksbaeder,
