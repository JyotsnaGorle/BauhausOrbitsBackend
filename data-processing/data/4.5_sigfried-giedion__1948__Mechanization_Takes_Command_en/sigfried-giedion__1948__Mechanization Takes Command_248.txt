SPINE-CLEAVING MACHINES 
Even today, when electrical handsaws are available, an axe is nonnally used 
to split the disemboweled hog down the backbone. Around 1370, when mass 
production was the aim, the inventor was not lacking who sought to adapt the 
circular saw - useful in so many other situations - to the mechanization of 
slaughtering. 
It was deemed sufficient to slide the hogs automatically, lying on their backs, 
one after another down an inclined plane, to be sawed into halves by a rotary 
cutter. The bogs, the inventor claims, deliver themselves of their own accord to 
the cutter, and the backbone-splitting operation can proceed uninterruptedly."
