140. Carnival in a Dutch Kitchen, c.l475. Dutch Engraving of 1567. The entire social Beale lies between 
Fouquef's supreme court and the company of renelcrs in this Dutch kitchen. Yet common to both placcB is 
the improvi,sed manner of silting. They use e1wrything available: an overturned ba.<;kel, sf,ooh; of varying 
hei'ghts, or a chair with a stumpy back and turned legs, stemming from the Romanesqu.e tradition. 
Middle Ages- on plain wooden benches without hack rests, affording but little 
room for the legs - a striking contrast to the choir stall. The justices sit on 
the floor with astonishing informality, while six dignitaries on the steps of the 
royal throne are not much better off. There is no more comfort at this royal 
audience than in a circus tent. 
Such renunciation of comfort of the flesh at the French court -known, with 
the Burgundian, as the most refined of its day - typifies the attitude the meÂ­
dieval period preserved to the last. In the seventeenth century such an assembly 
would he unthinkable without the seating appropriate to its authority.

It matters little in our connection if the design is not after Hieronymus Bosch as is indicated on the 
engraving, which rather follows the archaic trend of the late sixteenth century, imitating usages of the late 
fifteenth.
