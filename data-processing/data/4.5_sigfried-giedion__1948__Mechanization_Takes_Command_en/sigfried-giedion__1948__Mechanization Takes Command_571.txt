not intereswd in the problem of its practical application. His was the attitude 
of the eighteenth-century scientist, inwreswd only in discovery. Regarding 
himself as a natural philosopher, he left the industrial exploitation to others. 
Many obstacles stood in the way of innnediate solution. Over half a century 
had to pass before the electric motor, from the small dimensions in which Fara­
day had conceived it, after passing through the gigantic, was again condensed 
into the small and reliable instrument; and almost a century before its ubiquitous 
use was taken for granted. 
The coming onto the market of the small electric power unit is closely linked 
with the name of Nicola Tesla, although it was far from being the main achieve­
ment of this master of high-frequency currents and of the multiple-phase motor 
that flrst made possible the economical transmission of energy. In the spring 
of 1889, almost innnediately after his pioneer patent for the multiple-phase 
motor, Nieola Tesla, together with the Westinghouse Company, put on the 
market a 1 horsepower alternating current motor directly driving a three-blade 
fan (flg. 386). This motor eould not be regulated in speed or direction. But 
the simple appliance, easily portable from one room to another, marks the 
starting point of innumerable moves to punctuate the house with local power 
units. The year 1889 saw many other patents drawn up for fans driven by 
66 
electric motors. But Tesla's simple apparatus owes its signifleance to the 
fact that it did not remain a mere idea, but was commercially manufactured 
and put on the market. 
The hot and damp American snmmer inevitably brought attempts to sub­
stitute mechanical devices for the band fan- something, at any raw, that 
should free the band of its waving to-and-fro motion. Such mechanisms 'oper­
67 
ated by means of a single lever and cord' might be pedal-driven or harnessed 
to a rocking chair. 'When a person is sitting in the chair and rocks it . . .' the 
68 
fan placed overhead 'is vibrated by the slightest motion of the chair.' If in 
the 'sixties one wanted a truly automatic fan, it would have to be a clockwork 
one. 'The case eontaining the works is attached to the ceiling and provided 
69 
with revolving wings.' There were also at this time clockwork fans for table­
70 
top use, adjustable in speed.
Nicola Tesla's electric fan of 1889 led the development by about a quarrer 
century. Electric current in the 'nineties in Europe as in America, was a luxury.
