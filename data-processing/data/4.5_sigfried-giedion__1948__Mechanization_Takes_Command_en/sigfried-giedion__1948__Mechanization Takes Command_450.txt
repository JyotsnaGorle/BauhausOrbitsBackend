269. Parlor Bed, 1891. lVardrobe beds, already known to lhe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were made 
to substitute .for a separate bedroom in many American dwellings of the palenl-furnilure era. They eventually 
succumbed to lhe rnling taste and became almost extinct, until revitâ€¢ed in the roomette. (Decorator and 
Furnisher. New York, 1891) 
270. Sleeping Car: Pullman Roomette, 1937. The roomefie t's not actually a room. It is combinaUonfur .. 
niture inside wldch the passenger can move. The bed, lowering on balanced springs, absorbs almosllhe entire 
floor space. Walls and upholstery will reveal cWsets, wash basin, and loiletfacililies. One of the few convertible 
pieces in which the lradition of !he 1850's has lived on. (Courtesy the Pullman Company)
