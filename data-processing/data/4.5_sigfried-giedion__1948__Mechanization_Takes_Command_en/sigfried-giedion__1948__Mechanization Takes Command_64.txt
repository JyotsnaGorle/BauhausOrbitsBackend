MECHANIZATION OF A COMPLICATED CRAFT 
The Craft of the Locksmith 
FoR SOME CENTURIES after the late Gothic period, the locksmith was known 
as the artisan of a most elahorate handicraft, He united mastery of hand with 
the gift of untiring inventiveness, His work included, besides locks, all sorts of 
artistically wrought ironwork: gates, grilles, knobs, bandk'S, and the fantastic 
iron ornamentation of chests, 
The Gothic period was very sparing of bodily comfort hut felt strongly that 
imagination should animate the objects of man's surroundings, The woodwork 
of a door is rough and not highly finished; the craftsman spent all his pains on 
the sensitive area of the door: the keyhole, He framed it with delicate ornamenta­
tion as if he were illuminating a mtmuscripL And the handle that draws the 
latch be transformed into an abstract serpentine shape ending in an animal 
head, as in the lock from a house at Visp, Switzerland (fig, 26), Later, in the 
eighteenth century, the last period of refined handicraft, craftsmen turned their 
energy to the creation of large-scale works like the wrought-iron grilles, screen­
ing choir from nave in monastery churches, surrounding parks, or forming the 
gates of public squares, They wove transparent iron veils before the altar or 
the park, In one case the artist-locksmith binds into the architectonic space 
his high iron structure, the water curtains of the sculptured fountains, and the

green beyond, 
The development of this artistry ran parallel with the achievement of eight­
eenth-century furniture and comfort beginning with the last years of Louis XIV 
and the Regency.' 
Louis Sebastien Mercier, the remarkable critic of the end of the Ancien Regime, 
was one of the first to see a city from a sociologist's point of view, It has been 
said that he described the cellar and the attic but forgot the salon, When he 
comes to the refined handicraft, the critic is carried away, Mercier describes 
with the directness of a contemporary the high standard of craftsmanship a 
few years before the French Revolution: 'Our smith has become an artist, Art 
has so wrought the metal as to fuse it with architecture; it has been developed 
into superb grilles which have the advantage of enhancing the view without 
1 It was Jean Lamour (1698-1771) who accomplished this in Nanc-y, when he adorned the three most 
elaborate squares of the late Baroque. In one of them, the Place Stanislas (175l-5),he spans the open 
side between two of its corners with hovering iron grilles. (Cf. Lamour, Recueil des ou11rages de serrurerie 
sur laPlace Royale de Na.ncy, Paris, 1767.)
