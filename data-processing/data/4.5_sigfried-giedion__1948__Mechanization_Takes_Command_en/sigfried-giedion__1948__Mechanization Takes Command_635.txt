440a. Living Kitchen with Dining Area and Laundry, Raymond Fordyce, 1945. In the 'forties the kitchen 
is restored to its functional value, ami a tremi toward larger area is noticeable. Fordyce terms this the 'living 
kitchm,' and wishes to make il an acii'l!e center of Jwusehold life, where the family can work, play, eat. We 
mentioned the buicher's block in the cenler, used to cut up large pieces of meat, in connection with quick freezing. 
Will ilw sociological trend to the servantless household bring a return to some medieval ways, ami regard cooking 
as an interesting process that may be performed openly, not behind closed doors? (Courtesy Life Magazine) 
The problem is clear. The solution seems less evident. Is the family to take 
its meals in the kitchen, as in the burgher household down to the eighteenth 
century? Or should the kitchen he more closely drawn together with the dining 
room or living area? Should it remain a working tool exclusively? Or, when 
its function is fulfilled, should it turn into a parlor or play room 1 
Here we can hut sketch the prohlem in the broadest strokes. The servantless 
household forms the framework. The actual solutions will depend on the mode 
of life aimed at. 
The process here running its course is not limited to the kitchen. It is hound 
'!P with a changed conception of the house and with the development of the 
open ground plan. From mid-'twenties on, there grew a demand for, in place 
of the rigid room, an area in which one can freely move about. Even in modest 
interiors, the wish is ever more clearly voiced for a large room which may he 
flexibly used.
