Others, for sanctuary from mosquitoes, envelop the hammock in a cylindrical 
00 
net carried on sliding hoops (fig. 304).' To one inventor comes the bizarre 
inspiration for a hammock that instead of swinging between two boughs hangs 
101 
on an overturned tricycle. At the same time ropes fold the body at its joints 
so that it will occupy less than its normal length. Finally, a waterproof cloth 
is stretched over this tricycle of the 'eighties 'to convert the vehicle into a 
sleeping apartment' (fig. 305). 
We do not hesitate to present examples of such grotesque flavor. Taking 
a broader view, it matters little whether or not these particular proposals were 
successful in practice. What matters here is to show the imagination, impetuous 
and even bordering on the ludicrous, that was at work to release furniture from 
its rigidity. But this urge, even in the limited field of the hammock, is not 
confined to the grotesque. 
FJaboration of the hammock into a kind. of combination furniture is not 
astonishing for this period. One of the most appealing solutions, of the early 
102 
'eighties, is preserved in an advertising leaflet (fig. 307). Taken over from 
the hammock is its light suspension beneath a bough, or from a hook. The 
light frame, capable of assuming many positions of halance, hecomes by a mere 
shift of the body now a kind of hammock and easy chair, now a swinging seat.
