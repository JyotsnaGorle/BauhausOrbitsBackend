theatrically conceived piece is not a throne but an armchair designed for a wealthy client. (RecueiJ de de-.

Napoleon was brought to power by the French Revolution. The ideas of the 
Revolution, invisible aids, stood over his conquests. True he turned vanquished 
lands into tools for his war machine. He bled them white; he plundered the 
Italian galleries; whatever art objects he could lay hands on he carried across the 
Alps. And in 1798, during the first Industrial Exhibition held in Paris, he led 
the masterpieces forth on triumphal chariots, as hostages were once displayed 
to the Roman people. 
But Napoleon was not merely the conqueror. He at the same time swept 
Austrian despotism out of Italy, confined the Pope within boundaries, and set 
up a democratic constitution for the newly founded Italian republics. This 
was in the beginning.
