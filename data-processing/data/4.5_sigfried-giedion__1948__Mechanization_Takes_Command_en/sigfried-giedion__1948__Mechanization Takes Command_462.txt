281. 'Car SPat and Couch,' 185-l, 'Fir~!.' American Sleeping-Car Patent Jloritonlal s/et'J)ing surfaces 
are obtained liy folrhng rmer the seaL~ and the seal back.s. The sleeping car t:w!red.from the revrrsib!e and con­
rerlible car-seal: early inventors did noi use the word 'slrf>ping car,' but, lilte the inventors Q( railway seals, 
spoke of 'couches' or 'seal imprmwmenls.' A.s there are no sharp lransilionR, there is some arbtlrariness in 
callin,q this solution of 185-·t the 'first' American sleeping-car patent. (U.S. Palenlll,699, 19 September 1851) 
On the threshold of ihe great railroa<! panic in 1873, a record trackage was 
built: almost 7500 miles in 1871, or more than the total construelion of the 
first twenty years. Closely connected witi1 this expansion was the rise of the 
luxury car in its various types. But- it should always be stressed-- a demand 
for heightened comfort in American travel was already finding its response at 
a time when train mns on European and American lines were nearly comparable 
in length. The luxury types were in use on the regular routes several years 
before the transcontinental lines were opened. In 1869 the Union Pacific, build­
ing from the East, made junction with the Central Pacific, building from San 
Francisco. And in 1870, when George M. Pullman invited the Boston Board 
of Trade on the first through-journey across the continent, made in seven days, 
he had only to pool the cars in his depots. 
The luxury types entered service in this sequence: 1865, the palace sleeping

car Pioneer; 1867-8, hotel car and dining car; 1867, drawing-room car of 
'Vebstcr VVagner, Pullman's competitor, who succeeded in running hls cars on 
the Vanderbilt lines, where they continued in operation until after Pullman's 
death in 1897; 1875, Pullman's drawing-room car, at first called 'reclining-chair 
60 
The hotel car combimxl: the sleeping and dining cars; !he dining car pointed to the present-day type. 
Pullman's patents for these t;ypes were granted the following year, 1869 (U.S. Patents 89,537 and 89,538, 
27 Apr. 1869).
