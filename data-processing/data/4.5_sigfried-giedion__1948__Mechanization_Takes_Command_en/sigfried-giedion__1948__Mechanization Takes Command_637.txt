cautiously employed iu bachelor dwellings, as in an early Swiss example of 1927). " 
They appear iu the luxurious dream kitchens of the 'forties (figs. 351, 439). 
The opening of the ground plan made deep inroads into the isolation of the 
kitchen. With the force of one attacking single-banded, Frank Lloyd Wright 
leapt over the whole problem of the streamline kitchen. In 1934, just as Ameri­
can industry was growing receptive to his ideas, he tackled the problem more 
radically than any of the younger Americans a decade later. In one of his 
195 
houses he opened the·ki!tchen along its whole length into the large living room. 
Wright pointa out to his biographer with his usual directness, 'Here for the 
first time the spar,e of the kitchen, now called by Wright the "work space," is 
196 
joined to that of the living room.' He took up the problem again in 1940 
in the Gregor Affieck House, Bloomfield Hills (Michigan). Now he builds his 
kitchen two stories high, so that the cooking odors may pass straight upwards 
(figs. 437, 438). Objections are possible. These individual solutions could hardly 
expect the same popularity as Wright's 'car port,' the doorless garage; but from 
the first the direction of the whole development is clearly and unambiguously 
announced. 
}<'rank lloyd Wright's solution implies that cooking need no longer he done 
behind closed doors, hidden from the eyes of the family or from guests. The 
detailed treatment of the kitchen, whether it shall he entirely opened or screened 
from the living room hy transparent glass closets (figs. 439, 440), or marked off 
197 
by panes of glass with view into the main room lies in the hands of the archi­
tect and depends on his ability to find the living form demanded hy new needs. 
The Kitchen-Dining Room? 
The minimal-sized kitchen and bedroom, which the architectural movement 
of the 'twenties brought to the fore, was a necessity. Only thus could the unor­
gaaized rooms reconquer their functional values. The trend toward larger bed­
rooms and larger kitchens- in short, tow.rrd space in which to move- asserts 
itself everywhere. The £.. and U-shaped kitchens are now made l.rrger, in order 
to serve as a dining room also, as stressed by J. J. P. Oud in his W eissenhof 
kitchen (1927). In 1945 the trend had gone so far that mechanized" kitchen and 
laundry unit, also to he used as a sewing room as in Raymond Fordyce's pro-
