cans a century before, which boldly molded to the human body the lines of the 
rigid Empire sofa or 'psyche.' The chaise longue basculanle is adjustable. Its 
immediate ancestor is the invalid chair formed of two separate parts- an inde­
pendent base on which is mounted a sitting or lying surface. Such invalid chairs 
were everywhere to be found in the nineteenth century. 
On the broad, black base of the adjustable recliner rests the chromium-tubed 
upper part, secured at any desired angle by its adherence to two rnbber pads 
on the underframe. Unlike the mobile planes of the invalid chair, the support­
ing surfaces of the chaiselongue basculante are bound in a rigid curve. This 
means that the sitter must rise to his feet whenever he wishes to alter the slope. 
And as in much of the furniture of this time, rising is not too easy. Adjustable 
chairs- the barber's, the office chair, or the adjustable lounge- restore the 
sitter to the normal position as he rises. 
Not the least appeal of the adjustable recliner is its contrast of vigorously 
curved planes above the single span of the base. Heservations apart, one must 
admit that a century of effort to make lounges adjustable to the body is here 
condensed in classical form. It should he mentioned that France did not 
further develop the cantilever chair.
