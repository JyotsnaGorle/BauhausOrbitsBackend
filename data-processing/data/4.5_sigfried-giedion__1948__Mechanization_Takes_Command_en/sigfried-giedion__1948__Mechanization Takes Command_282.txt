143. Swi..,;s Schoolroom, 1516: 'Schoolmaster's Sign,' Hans Holbein the Younger. This early si:rleenthÂ­
cenlury scene Blifl shows the imprmised rrwde of sitting: a boy sealed on the bench rests his exercise book on his 
knee.'!', while another .~illing behind him on a sort of .foofstool, somewhat in the manner of Pythagora.~ at 
Chartres, uses the bench as a deBk. (CourleBy Kunst Mu.~eum, Basel) 
south at any rate- the chair was losing its rare, honorific value, and is used in 
senes. 
In the sixteenth century this type is fitted with four peg-legs, instead of three, 
and the back rest is widened and curved. A sturdy type, it survives in Alpine 
peasant houses of today: one board for the back, another for the seat, and four 
pegs for the legs. This chair, which becomes increasingly adorned with florid 
carving, is primitively constructed. It points nevertheless to a changed mode 
of living. The table has become fixed and the seat movable. The chair is pushed 
up to the table, not the table to the fixed bench as before. The three-legged stools 
of the fifteenth century, whose legs were often turned as in Romanesque times, 
had been but occasional pieces. Now everyone has his chair at the table. The 
chair has ceased to be an honorary seat, a symbol of unusual distinction, and 
is placed in serie.; around the table. 
But as late as the first half of the sixteenth century, chairs are not the 
rule, even in the highest places. When Hans Holbein the Younger portrays 
Henry VIII and his privy council, in 1530, his woodcut shows the members of 
this exalted body as tightly packed on low-back benches as were the members 
of the Lii de Justice in 1458.
