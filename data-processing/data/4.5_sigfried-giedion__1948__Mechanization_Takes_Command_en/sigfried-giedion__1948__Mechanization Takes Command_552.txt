359. Combined Fireplace, Boiler, and Cast-Iron Oven, 1806. A friend of Oliver Evans, inventor of the as­
sembly line, offers this very early scheme combining a lwi-wafer boiler and oven with an open fireplace. 'By 
drawing a damper either of them will heal by the fire that is used in common. The boiler should have a tube with 
brass cock which projecting into the kitchen gives hoi water whenever wanted.' (S. W. Johnson, Rural F_,con­
omy, 1806) 
360. Improved Range with Boiler, 1871. In this period the free-standing, unimulated vertical boiler, still 
found in American farm houses, carne info use. (Manufacturer and Builder, New York, November 1871) 
All that at first glance distinguishes them from the coal range is the table-like 
frame on which they stand, whose curved and highly omamented cast-iron legs 
seem to have emigrated from some Regency salon. These models had their day 
from the 'nineties into the second decade of our centUC)'. With their exuberant 
ornamentation of their silvery metal, they betray the inner insecurity and help­
lessness of that prosperons era. 
But these diversions are secondary. Of greA:lter consequence was the fact 
that, bogged in the pattern of the mal range, the gas range was segregated 
within an insulating zone. This delayed its merging into the kitchen work­
process. 
Side by side with this, however, ran another form more in keeping with the 
nature of the gas cooker. Here the flat range top, cut by circular burners, pre­
vailed, as in the model seen at the Great Exhibition of 1851. The broiler and 
oven occupy the space beneath, while to either side perforated stacking surfaces 
extend the range top.
