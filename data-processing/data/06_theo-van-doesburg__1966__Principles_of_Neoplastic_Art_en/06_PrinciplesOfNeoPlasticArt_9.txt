FIRST CHAPTER 
THE NATURE OF VISUAL ART 
I. Everything that surrounds us is an expression of life. Every 
living thing experiences its environment consciously or uncon­
sciously. 
Various philosophers and biologists (Descart es, Darwin, Kant, Von 
Uxkiill and others) have proved experimentally that the higher a living 
creature in the scale of organisms the more conscious will be its experience, 
the lower its place in this scale the less conscious will it be. Thus we call 
the vital consciousness of the humbler living creatures mere instinct but 
that of the higher creatures, like man, understanding, reason, and intellect. 
J ean-Jacques Rousseau has shown in his Emile that the experience of an 
individual creature undergoes a specific evolution and that this evolution 
of experience corresponds to the growth of the man from childhood to 
adult life. 
Example 1 
A child, having as yet no experience of space, reaches for distant things, 
e.g., the moon. Only gradually does the child sense (by grasping, running, 
etc.) that certain things are near, others distant. Thus it will learn which 
objects are 'close to' and which 'far away' and will itself come to exper­
ience space and its relationship to him (the child). 
II. Consciously or unconsciously every creature turns its ex­
perience of life to use. 
Experience of life is thus practical and, in so far as this practicality is 
related to mat erial conditions, the individual will be capable of reacting
