If an artist's experience is predominantly aesthetic, aesthetic accents•) 
will also preponderate in his formative embodiment of the experience. 
If other components find their way into the aesthetic experience, e.g. _ 
feelings of liking or dislike, feelings of pity for the object of the experience, 
the aesthetic experience will be weakened, sometimes even destroyed. This 
relegates the aesthetic accents to the background, the experience has a 
different content and the work of art a different significance, no longer a 
purely aesthetic one. We shall return to this in the chapter 'On looking at 
works of art'. 
XVI. The aesthetic value of a work of art depends upon the 
degree of distinctness of the aesthetic accents. 
If the aesthetic accents are weak, indistinct or lacking altogether, or if 
they are replaced by other accents, the work accordingly loses in artistic 
significance. 
If, however, the aesthetic accents appear clear and unalloyed- if there 
is, let us say, a balanced relationship of two formative elements, e.g., colour 
and space, form and colour, etc. - and if these aesthetic accents are or­
ganized into a formative unity, tied to nothing other than the expressional 
means of their branch of art, we may say that the work of (visual) art is 
'exact' (Fig. 9-11). 
e) The answer to the question, how does the artist arrive at these aesthetic accents, is: through an inter­
play between subject (the artist's mind) and object (reality). While it can be taken for granted that the 
artist will in future need no specific objective theme for the individual work of art, it must be emphasized 
that all works of art must be indirectly based upon experiences of reality.
