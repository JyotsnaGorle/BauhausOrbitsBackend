with modern pictures, his imaginative faculty was working within a 
purely sensory nexus. 
The manner in which he reacted to the Greek sculptures may be called 
sensory and associative, because his attention was fixed upon the shape­
liness of the bodily forms which he measured directly against their rela­
tionship to reality and the bodily forms he had observed in the real world. 
The manner in which he reacted to the Egyptian sculpture was sensory 
and associative because he related the forms and symbols he saw directly 
with reality (the Nile, sun, moon, agriculture, etc.) 
His attitude to the first of the modern pictures was sensory and 
associative because the optically perceptible subject -playing cards- im­
mediately suggested to him the idea of a skat party. 
His reaction to the exact, formative work of art must be called sensory 
and associative because his optical perception was confined to the sensorily 
perceptible artistic means, which, because they used rectangular planes, 
awoke in his imagination the idea of a child's toy he had observed in reality, 
a box of bricks. 
It was not the purpose of the four creators of these works of art to arouse 
a purely sensory and associative gratification (there are even painters -
the painter of the example just quoted was one - who alternate sensory 
and associative gratification with artistic stimulation); these artists were 
solely concerned witli exteriorizing their intellectual (aesthetic) experience 
of reality. We may therefore conclude with a clear conscience that the 
person in my example is incapable of an artistic (aesthetic) relationship with 
a work of art, exact or inexact. 
Since, usually because they have been badly trained in receptivity, 
people who come into contact with art (music, visual art, literature, etc.) 
react in the manner described above, that is, sensorily and associatively, 
it may be said without exaggeration (in view of the innumerable and daily 
multiplying examples) that where art in general is concerned the means
